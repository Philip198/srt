1
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,673
Goddess Bast, time is running out.

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,183
Help me heal my brother.

3
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:13,374
And I won't doubt it
your existence again.

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:16,664
- His pulse dropped.
- The sequence is almost over.

5
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:21,666
- Grio, give me control.
- As you wish, Princess.

6
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:29,653
- What is the success rate?
- At 25%.

7
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:31,654
I have to try something else.

8
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,646
King Chala's heartbeat
decreased to 31 beats per minute.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,654
- Princess, you must go next to him.
- I have to think. Get out.

10
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:43,678
Get out!

11
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,658
- What is the success rate?
- At 29.1%.

12
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,671
Print it!

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,653
I know it's urgent, but I have to
to warn you

14
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:05,663
This synthetic heart is nothing like it
to have the desired effect.

15
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:09,681
I do not care!
It should work.

16
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,648
- Gray...
- Yes, princess?

17
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,674
What is my brother's heart rate?

18
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:42,681
Your brother is with the ancestors.

19
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,676
No...

20
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,652
Thanks for the gift.

21
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:03,648
By King Anda Raja T'Challa.

22
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,139
Of the Black Panther.

23
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,807
His son Putra Raja T'Chaka.

24
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:14,266
My son.

25
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:20,075
Descendants of the great King Basenga,

26
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:22,925
Of the first Black Panther.

27
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:27,671
He left us and went away.
We honor the ancestors.

28
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:51,323
I'll miss you...

29
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,150
{\an8}<font color=#EC0000>Sync / Render Dialogs: lykos478</font>

31
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,673
{\an5}A YEAR LATER

32
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,673
{\an5}UN, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

33
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:36,656
It is an honor for me to invite
Your Majesty Queen Ramon,

34
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,666
Princess Lumumba,
and the Queen of Wakanda.

35
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,649
Sir, Secretary.

36
00:06:56,673 --> 00:07:01,665
I want to speak for everyone
of the Member States when I say,

37
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,185
that I am deeply disappointed
since the failure of Wakanda

38
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,205
to live up to their promises,

39
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:12,657
to become a global player,
to overcome international challenges,

40
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:18,647
to share resources and collaborate
fully for vibranium.

41
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,647
France has said,

42
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,413
that vibranium
can be used

43
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:26,063
for weapons production
mass destruction.

44
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:30,657
The substance does not activate
the metal detectors.

45
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:35,665
This is a safety hazard
and the non-proliferation treaty.

46
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,673
I give the floor to Queen Ramon.

47
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:51,653
Our policy has always been not to
we ever deal with vibranium

48
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:54,654
under any circumstances.

49
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:59,655
Not because of potential
dangers of vibranium,

50
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,673
but at your own risk.

51
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,682
{\an5}FOUR FAMILIES
WAKANDA ANSOGOU, MALI

52
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,325
The image on the monitor went black.

53
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:26,111
Calm down!
Fall to the floor!

54
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,378
Where is the vibranium?

55
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,681
Who has access to it?

56
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:49,657
Pretend to be polite.

57
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:54,650
But we know why you're talking
inside government buildings

58
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:57,688
and in military installations.

59
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,668
"The king is dead."

60
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:08,686
Black Panther is gone.

61
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:14,666
They lost their patron.

62
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:23,681
Now we have the opportunity to...

63
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:25,685
"...we attack."

64
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:57,670
- Varius, where is your spear?
- Suri gave me these.

65
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,646
I prefer them.

66
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,678
Our ancestors gave us the spears.

67
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:09,676
... on and off.

68
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:14,475
Nothing changes under my watch.

69
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,193
Yes, General.

70
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,682
I said don't take them.

71
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:27,491
Last night an installation of ours
was attacked.

72
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,660
I can prove that the UN
is behind it

73
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:36,573
as it downloads to your phone.

74
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,546
And as for the identity of the culprit...

75
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,689
Kneel down!

76
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,619
Here is.

77
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:06,676
Consider the answer to this
the attack as a friendly gesture.

78
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:13,664
Further attempts to steal our resources
will be considered an attack

79
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:19,651
and will cause
a stronger reaction from us.

80
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:25,650
We mourn our king.
But don't believe at all,

81
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:31,119
that Wakanda has lost the ability
to protect its resources.

82
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,324
We know your efforts
which are under development

83
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:37,734
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda.

84
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:43,058
And I wish you good luck.

85
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:50,671
Atlantic ocean
Rotor 625 requested clearance to land.

86
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:56,684
See you inside.

87
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:04,195
- Didn't you retire?
- I thought so too.

88
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:07,897
The odds of finding vibranium
they should be very few.

89
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:09,039
I think so too.

90
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,689
Cabin pressure good.

91
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,647
240 meters.

92
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:46,710
- Move to the next layer.
- All systems OK.

93
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,670
Received.

94
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,253
We have reached the bottom.

95
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:11,526
Great then, Salazar, you're close.

96
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:15,008
This is awesome.

97
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,928
The drill seems to have
hit something like metal.

98
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:22,356
At least it's stable.

99
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:25,624
I've never seen a drill before
to be so shattered.

100
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:32,373
Amen, man.
Vibran in the ocean.

101
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:36,293
Let's get rid of the tracker.
It's all we have.

102
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:39,624
We are heading
in the vibranium detector.

103
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,804
- Everything went dark.
- Power supply stopped.

104
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,756
I'll take care of it from now on.

105
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:14,679
What the hell was that?

106
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,759
Jackson, did you see that too?

107
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,104
Salazar's beats.

108
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,290
Salazar, can you take a picture?

109
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:40,945
A jellyfish.
I have never seen such a color before.

110
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,715
Rescue Squad, alert.

111
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:47,345
Salazar, Jackson's Vital Organs
they do not work. You see him;

112
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,243
- No, he left.
- What do you mean, he left?

113
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:04,667
Salazar, can you hear me?
Salazar?

114
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,686
NO SIGNAL

115
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,060
Smith, something is wrong.

116
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,999
- What sound is that?
- Where is that sound coming from?

117
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,789
From the west, finally?

118
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:38,582
West, do you see anything?

119
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:01,459
- It's a sonic attack.
- Wear earplugs.

120
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,326
We are under attack.
Send in a strike team.

121
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:15,094
Help, help. 625 rotors here.

122
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:16,565
Send help immediately.

123
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,610
He's from Wakanda.

124
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,951
Of course.

125
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:37,817
Henderson!

126
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,169
We have to get out of here.

127
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,369
Henderson!

128
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:42,681
Come!

129
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,681
- What happens;
- Get down from there.

130
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:05,675
Chase her!

131
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,682
Throw, Throw, Throw!

132
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,681
Fly, get rid of them!

133
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,089
- They leave.
- Oh my god...

134
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,687
- Take us away.
- We are OK.

135
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,259
Where's the strike team?

136
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,599
The code is blue.
Everyone is dead.

137
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,517
- What happened;
- They're pulling us back!

138
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:25,676
Wait!

139
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:04,733
The Queen of Wakanda gave yesterday
a strong speech at the United Nations,

140
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:09,456
while the captured mercenaries
were brought before the Assembly.

141
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:13,406
The Queen is restored
as regent of Wakanda,

142
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,937
when King Chala died
last year from an unknown illness.

143
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,651
This small nation is preparing for battle
and is increasingly isolated.

144
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:26,133
Highness...
We are approaching the border.

145
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:34,260
We returned home.

146
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:27,907
- Princess...
- Wait a minute, I'm doing something.

147
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:31,369
- I know, but...
- You're interrupting my thoughts.

148
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:37,077
- Suri.
- Mother.

149
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,459
I wanted to tell you that the queen has arrived.

150
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:41,391
Thanks.

151
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:46,684
You make me nervous. One day the artificial
intelligence will kill us all.

152
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:49,075
Artificial intelligence
it's not like in the movies.

153
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,548
It's exactly what I tell him to do.

154
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,563
I wish all kids were like that.

155
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:57,923
Everyone seems to be working hard.

156
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:01,921
This is the emergency team.

157
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,123
There can be many threats
out there and we find the solutions.

158
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:12,004
- What is this;
- Uniforms for soldiers.

159
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:16,890
It provides the user with increased
strength, speed and endurance.

160
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,236
But like everything they don't like it.

161
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,382
- Which one;
- He hates them.

162
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:30,169
What about creating a heart?

163
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:32,384
Have you ever thought
that he would not approve?

164
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,321
sorry princess
Nakia, Princess of Yaa,

165
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,758
is trying to find you again.

166
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:39,650
- Maybe I should...
- Be careful with the calculations

167
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,147
and don't distract me.

168
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:42,584
As you wish princess.

169
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:48,708
We don't need the filter.
We need new technology.

170
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:50,212
What will happen to black panther?

171
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:57,073
This title has stuck with the nation for centuries.

172
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,205
Black Panther is a thing of the past.

173
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:01,462
I wasn't trying to save the title.

174
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:03,597
I was trying to save my brother.

175
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:07,217
Shuri...

176
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:24,273
- What day is today;
- Tuesday.

177
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:27,270
Date, son.

178
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,424
- My brother died.
- It was a year ago.

179
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:51,245
- Have you planned anything?
- Yes. We must be together.

180
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,248
- Now?
- Yes.

181
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:56,106
Just leave the chemotherapy pearls.

182
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:58,736
You won't need them where we're going.

183
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:04,889
Also the other two.

184
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:33,936
Sit here with me and alone.

185
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:36,820
It's the only way for them to heal

186
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:39,283
the wounds after T'Challa's death.

187
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:40,578
I'm fine, mother.

188
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:43,934
Do not worry about me.

189
00:23:45,252 --> 00:23:48,916
He left, but I moved on.

190
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,611
Chala is dead,
but it doesn't mean it's gone.

191
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,273
When the disease killed
your brother

192
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:01,373
I had to lead a nation
wounded in a world in crisis.

193
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:04,347
But I still went to the bushes.

194
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,960
I wandered until I found water,

195
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:10,272
and then I sat down.

196
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:15,635
So I did the ritual
which I will show you now.

197
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:23,235
I found your brother in the breeze.

198
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:27,244
He pushed me gently but firmly,

199
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:31,248
whose hand was on my shoulder.

200
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:34,273
It's been a while,

201
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:38,257
but it was there.

202
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:46,238
He wasn't there, mother.

203
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:50,291
The presence you felt
it is an illusion of the mind

204
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:55,421
to entertain you
or to please you.

205
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,273
Only that.

206
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:10,247
What feeling do you feel?
when you think of your brother?

207
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:13,273
It brings you comfort...

208
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:15,273
...or sadness?

209
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:31,262
Come on, my child.

210
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,231
- Where did you find this;
- Does not matter;

211
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:48,230
What do they have to do with ritual?

212
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:53,291
We burn the funeral clothes to
end the mourning period

213
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:58,973
and start new relationships
leaving our loved ones.

214
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:00,626
I don't know, mom.

215
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:07,234
If I sit I will think
my brother for a long time...

216
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:09,966
... not the clothes I burned.

217
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,269
The whole world does that.

218
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:18,268
Shuri...

219
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:27,610
Suri, there's something you have to do
to tell you about your brother.

220
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:34,270
Mother, wait.
What are you doing;

221
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:03,478
- Is it part of the ceremony?
- No it is not.

222
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:06,944
Keep still!

223
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,550
Who are you and how did you get in here?

224
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,619
This place is perfect.

225
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:16,342
The air is still pristine.

226
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,014
And the water...

227
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:22,748
My mom told me about it.

228
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:25,657
protected country,
where people never leave

229
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:29,391
or change their lifestyle.

230
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:33,088
What reason did you have to reveal?
this secret in the world?

231
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,945
I don't like repeating myself.

232
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,625
Who you are;

233
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,942
I have many names.

234
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:43,510
My folks call me Kukulan.

235
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:48,128
My enemies call me Namor.

236
00:27:49,265 --> 00:27:54,364
The US military found vibranium
under my own Royal rule.

237
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:58,685
I could stop the export,

238
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,082
but we needed
the help of wakanda,

239
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:02,654
so that it doesn't happen again.

240
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:06,641
They have a machine developed
by a scientist.

241
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:10,471
Vibranium is only found here.

242
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,839
Mom, he's covered in it.

243
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,970
Your son revealed
the power of vibranium, in the world.

244
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,647
It had caused other countries to terminate
this planet after that.

245
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:28,058
His choice put us in danger.

246
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:32,365
I think you can find some
researchers and bring them to me.

247
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,378
It's only natural that Wakanda should help
in solving our dilemma.

248
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:42,485
You are sneaking into my country
and you tell me what is fair.

249
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,255
My army is so
as numerous as blades of grass

250
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:51,196
and their power is incomparable.

251
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:54,298
I would not return under any other circumstances.

252
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:03,254
When you find the researchers, burn them.

253
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:06,992
Then I'll be there in no time.

254
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:11,618
For your own sake,

255
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:15,919
please don't say my name
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

256
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:27,266
Did you see the feathers on his ankles?

257
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:44,228
How did he do it?

258
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,766
We must convene the Council.

259
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:51,934
Heaven Scrapers has not
recorded activity.

260
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,752
Was the river border breached?

261
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:00,860
I wish my soldiers were there,

262
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,129
this fisherman would already be in front of you.

263
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:10,732
If your army was there,
they would still lie there dazed.

264
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:14,012
- You are a bald devil.
- Show each other respect.

265
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:14,920
Respect?

266
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:18,923
- These people should be ashamed.
- Watch how you speak, Jabari.

267
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:36,964
As I said, he didn't show up
on some surveillance camera.

268
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:42,102
- Not even on the radar.
- Did he swim 100 kilometers?

269
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,914
And he claims to lead a large army.

270
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:51,437
He wants us to catch an investigator
American to kill him?

271
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:52,610
Do it.

272
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:58,402
We never had an enemy that had vibranium

273
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,737
and we don't have Black Panther
to protect us.

274
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:05,254
Why did you let Kilman take the throne?

275
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:08,070
and burn all heart-shaped potions.

276
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,271
- Baku, what do you want us to do?
- Find the fisherman and kill him.

277
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:17,141
If we do what he asks now,

278
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:21,943
what will prevent him from coming
and demand more?

279
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,249
Sit down.

280
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:39,971
- Is it my idea or is it ugly?
- It's your idea.

281
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:41,976
It works;

282
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:46,423
Yes, the machine can
to detect vibranium

283
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,628
through water, rocks
and heavy metals.

284
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:51,594
Whoever did this
he is an excellent inventor.

285
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:52,918
Come and see.

286
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,606
Some pieces are manufactured
By order,

287
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,530
while others look like something out of a mantra.

288
00:31:58,824 --> 00:32:03,708
I still find it hard to believe
that there is vibranium outside of Wukanda.

289
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:06,051
There may have been two meteorites.

290
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,317
The planet is covered mostly by water,

291
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:11,662
so of course the others
to end up there.

292
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:16,544
- This changes everything we know.
- The mountains, all the myths...

293
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:21,944
- They are etched in my mind.
- That sounds painful.

294
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,677
Then we have to find
this researcher.

295
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:29,132
I have an idea.

296
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:33,547
- I'll need the princess.
- Don't subject her to this.

297
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:37,249
- She's not ready at all.
- Your Highness...

298
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:41,044
It would do her good to get out a little.

299
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,552
Maybe he needs it.

300
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,899
And I can handle
blindfolded Americans.

301
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,536
They are not the ones that worry me.

302
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:56,260
He got past our defenses.

303
00:32:56,412 --> 00:33:00,068
- It will not happen again.
- He's not alone.

304
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:02,270
He wants to be with me.

305
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:08,316
When are we going to visit?
my favorite colonist?

306
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,870
{\an5}ALEXANDRIA
VIRGINIA

307
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,304
Come on...

308
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:43,684
Yes, I'm in.
I follow.

309
00:33:46,254 --> 00:33:47,372
Slower.

310
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:57,639
- You couldn't call?
- I didn't know your number?

311
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,528
We are looking for the scientist

312
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:03,515
who discovered the vibranium detector.

313
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,230
Then you were in the Atlantic.

314
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:08,841
Ship drilling, many dead...

315
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:11,835
- What happened;
- Seriously?

316
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,823
It was us and the frogmen.

317
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:19,821
30 of the best
and two officers.

318
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,552
My personal friend, he died in one hit.

319
00:34:24,615 --> 00:34:29,108
- They were looking for vibranium...
- Wakanda is not behind this.

320
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:30,900
Then who was it?

321
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,839
For this to work...

322
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,098
When I give you information,
you have to give me something too.

323
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,191
We can't tell you that.

324
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:43,526
We need to communicate
with the investigators before it is too late.

325
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:47,241
You owe me this, Ross.
You owe it to my brother.

326
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:52,273
Okay, listen.

327
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:57,433
An agent was sentenced to death
with less than I will tell you now.

328
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:01,281
And our new boss is like a hawk.

329
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,073
We have to be very careful.

330
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:06,646
You also need to be careful
and be quick.

331
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,236
USA needs new engines,

332
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:10,792
and the girl is the only one
to the world that can make it.

333
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,068
- And they will chase it.
- Girl?

334
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:20,018
CAMBRIDGE
MASSACHUSETTS

335
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:26,930
- You forgot to transfer money.
- Yes.

336
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,960
- It's 800, right?
- That was yesterday.

337
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,183
- Now it's interest.
- This is robbery.

338
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:38,529
I made my own robot arm.
I just fixed the algorithm.

339
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:41,269
And how much will it cost?

340
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:47,268
Thanks

341
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:54,242
- Is this an iPhone?
- Primitive.

342
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:58,566
Your Highness, we found the investigator...

343
00:35:59,130 ​​--> 00:36:02,492
partner for Wakanda schools.

344
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,396
I hope he is a professor.

345
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:08,193
She is a student, a mother.

346
00:36:08,554 --> 00:36:10,185
We can't give her to Namor.

347
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:13,607
Bring her to Wakanda.

348
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,778
Yes, Your Highness.

349
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:22,622
- I'm in charge now.
- Let me talk to her.

350
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:26,640
- It would be more subtle.
- I can be discreet.

351
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:32,135
- What is;
- Nothing.

352
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,317
- Is this makeup?
- Nice.

353
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:39,235
- Is the shadow wrong?
- No, Fendi. You look fine.

354
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:43,272
I can look like a student.
I can do it.

355
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,492
You have five minutes.

356
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:03,423
- Yes?
- Riri Williams?

357
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,632
I don't accept visitors.

358
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:10,160
You must visit
my website.

359
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,598
This is an encrypted file.
I'll leave it here.

360
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:17,258
Are you...

361
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:21,043
You are Princess Suri.

362
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:26,250
What are you doing here;
Will you recruit me?

363
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:33,246
No. I came for the scout
of the vibranium you made for the Co.

364
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,246
I didn't make it for the CIA,
but as a metallurgical mission.

365
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:43,242
- Homework;
- The teacher said it was impossible.

366
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:48,246
But we are young
talented and black.

367
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,263
Maybe we don't say that in Wakanda.

368
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:56,243
- How old are you;
- 19.

369
00:37:56,267 --> 00:38:00,910
A genius is not recognized
always by the elders.

370
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:05,330
- How much will it take?
- Several months.

371
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:06,530
Several months?

372
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:09,428
The hardest part was
to find enough leaves.

373
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,334
Is Wakanda mad at me?

374
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:15,944
Not just us.
You're in danger here.

375
00:38:16,665 --> 00:38:18,985
Pack your things and come with me.

376
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:23,136
I have calculus in a quarter of an hour...

377
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:26,245
Okay.

378
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:31,132
Okay, wait here.

379
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:33,138
I want to go to the bathroom.

380
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:42,837
- I had it under control.
- I said five minutes. Six passed.

381
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:46,259
Get out of my room.
Get out!

382
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,689
Don't come one step closer!

383
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:54,613
You see how they teach children
to deal with the guests?

384
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,233
- Do you have a spear with you?
- You brought a spear.

385
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:07,270
- I like.
- Put it down.

386
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,245
- You're going to get hurt.
- Leave me, my daughter.

387
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:17,233
Girl, I'm giving you two choices.

388
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:21,678
You can come to Wakanda
alive or unconscious.

389
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:28,180
You should take more care
your appearance, than your face.

390
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,100
- Do you find it funny?
- No it is not.

391
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,157
- I told you.
- You were fine.

392
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:35,466
Let's go.

393
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:38,878
Let's tell him to come
to fight alongside the mermaid

394
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:43,771
with ankle feathers,
who wants to kill him, alone.

395
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:45,394
You can do it easily.

396
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:46,796
You and your heater.

397
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,253
Here you go;

398
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,445
Where are we;

399
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:01,479
I built some cars for the boss.

400
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:07,459
And it allows me to work.
I have to get my laptop.

401
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:15,283
- Please don't touch anything.
- Do not worry.

402
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:19,504
It may not seem,
but it is my life's work.

403
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:23,765
Well, the image on the screen
do you have it on your laptop too?

404
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,256
And you've left it at that
open in the workshop?

405
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:30,591
It is encrypted at 2065-bytes.

406
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:32,058
Impressive.

407
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:36,139
- Have you ever been locked out?
- Yes, a whole semester.

408
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:40,558
I had to build a quantum computer
to crack my own encryption.

409
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:42,027
What technology is this?

410
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:44,708
- Is it Stark technology?
- I said don't touch anything.

411
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:47,811
Princess, the police just arrived.

412
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:50,872
- Who is this;
- My artificial intelligence.

413
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:53,468
They surround us.

414
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,716
You said a mermaid is chasing me.
These are Federalists.

415
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:19,480
I don't need this.
I swear.

416
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:22,620
This is not going to go very well.
I was very dumb.

417
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:28,841
The Princess of Wakanda has arrived
at my door, then all was lost.

418
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:32,755
I'm thinking of risking it, with the mermaid.

419
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:36,292
At least he hasn't
nothing to do with the FBI.

420
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:43,648
Namor sank a boat
of SIA because of your machine.

421
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,691
So for them it is the least
that you should worry about.

422
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:52,896
We have to work together to get out.
General, we are surrounded.

423
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,480
- Maybe we should split up.
- This is not possible.

424
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,448
- Do the vehicles work?
- No.

425
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,481
Everything works,
like these machines.

426
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:08,673
Forget it.
After all, there are three of us.

427
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:11,739
There are two of you.
I'll take this.

428
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:16,450
I knew the. Don't tell me
that you made it in two months?

429
00:42:16,474 --> 00:42:19,454
It took me ages with this one.

430
00:42:19,478 --> 00:42:24,151
- Have you ever thrown it away?
- It can fly;

431
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:27,957
There are many channels on YouTube
that guide you how to fly.

432
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,032
It's fantastic.

433
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:33,328
We have an arrest warrant
for Riri Williams!

434
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:36,288
We have a wireless device
so we will communicate.

435
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:40,626
General Okoi and Princess Shuri,
go out with your hands up.

436
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,634
- What scrap metal.
- Be careful with these.

437
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:46,921
The key is on the chair.

438
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:50,230
When we cross the bridge,
they won't be able to catch us.

439
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:51,912
We have to separate.

440
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,769
The laboratory is not our home.

441
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,472
- Then get in the car.
- He always has to shout.

442
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:08,505
We will break the door in three,

443
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:11,300
two one.

444
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,475
FBI!
Don't move.

445
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:19,460
- What was that;
- He has an Iron Man suit!

446
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,136
Stay still!

447
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,635
- So it flies.
- Gray...

448
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:28,191
- Yes, Princess.
- ...now!

449
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:29,834
Remote control activated.

450
00:43:30,053 --> 00:43:30,650
Let's go!

451
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:46,373
Grio, turn on the video.

452
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:56,044
- Gray...
- Yes, General.

453
00:43:56,244 --> 00:43:57,997
Take me to the princess.

454
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:01,233
Otherwise, I will nail
my spear to your editor

455
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,439
and you won't be able to edit
data for the next century.

456
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:05,660
Give me some time, General.

457
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,960
Okay, I'm coming to you.

458
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:23,461
- Grio, leave the control to me, now!
- I just opened the way for you.

459
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,681
You are in control General.
Manual control activated.

460
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,459
- We have to find a hiding place.
- Let's cross the river.

461
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:58,477
They have a block on the bridge.

462
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,521
Princess, you are being watched by a drone.

463
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,137
- At what height?
- Nine km.

464
00:45:14,472 --> 00:45:17,476
Wait, I'll arrange it.

465
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,920
Think, a little Riri, because you have to solve

466
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:27,369
the equation that is equal to
with the relative speed.

467
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:30,632
Riri, you can't make it
the drone without an oxygen mask.

468
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:35,443
Oxygen level: 55%.

469
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:38,466
Eight and a half kilometers.

470
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:42,081
Oxygen level: 30%.

471
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,478
Maximum acceleration. Regulation
Euler's point of view and I arrived.

472
00:45:56,468 --> 00:45:58,463
Oxygen level: 0%.

473
00:46:02,205 --> 00:46:04,003
The drone is no longer following you.

474
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:07,113
Altitude:
At 500 km it drops.

475
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:08,518
Rin, are you okay?

476
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:10,386
Riri!

477
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:14,694
I am fine.

478
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:18,281
No.

479
00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:23,074
I have a special tradition
in three, two, one...

480
00:46:25,378 --> 00:46:26,248
Well done Riri!

481
00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:36,458
What happened to him;

482
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,468
What happened; Shuri! Shuri!

483
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:26,073
The princess situation
is stable.

484
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:28,743
She will regain consciousness soon.

485
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,796
Take one more step
and I will kill you all.

486
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,542
Put your gun down!

487
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,444
Kill the scientist.
I will take the witnesses.

488
00:48:15,468 --> 00:48:16,537
Understandable.

489
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:19,316
It's blue;

490
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:23,160
Kill the woman first.

491
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,274
You don't want to mess with Namor.

492
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,092
You are not worthy of my sword.

493
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:27,170
Why are you late?

494
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,898
We don't have time for bullshit.

495
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:41,444
Perfect!

496
00:50:41,468 --> 00:50:43,479
- Wait!
- Enable translator.

497
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:49,247
I am Shuri, Princess of Wakanda.
Take me to Namor.

498
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,026
Don't bother the girl.

499
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:55,481
"Should we capture them alive?"

500
00:50:56,478 --> 00:50:58,465
"Yes, Atuma."

501
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:16,469
"Inhale."

502
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:26,464
Shuri!

503
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:47,205
Ross, Co.
Witnesses;

504
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,770
No, but we think so
that they are Wakandans.

505
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:54,475
- Langley says they're coming.
- Who called you?

506
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:57,461
She.

507
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:02,611
- Director de Fontaine.
- Seriously?

508
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:06,453
They think they are Wakandans.

509
00:52:06,477 --> 00:52:11,452
We monitor everything.
That's why I called you.

510
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:16,444
You look fine.
Are you done with the gym?

511
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:20,498
- Yes, last year.
- Then let me ride a bike.

512
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:23,442
I am the agent in charge.

513
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:26,328
Well done. Would you mind
tell me what happened here?

514
00:52:26,754 --> 00:52:27,623
- Yes.
- Nice.

515
00:52:27,823 --> 00:52:30,327
Okay, so what happened.

516
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:34,024
We thought it was a car accident,
but we could not find the car.

517
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:36,861
- Was it like this when you came?
- Yes.

518
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:41,457
We think someone took the car out
off the road and fell into the river.

519
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:44,439
You can't be serious.

520
00:52:44,463 --> 00:52:48,446
To go to the laboratories immediately.
Send it to the NSA immediately.

521
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,449
Ross, would you mind?
take me back to langley?

522
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:56,714
- The trip is eight hours.
- We will talk about the case.

523
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,453
I actually want too

524
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:02,643
to apologize for some
things i said when we got married

525
00:53:05,469 --> 00:53:10,306
They are blue and have superpowers.

526
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:14,441
They came out of the water above
on the backs of whales.

527
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:19,443
I killed three of them,
But they got up again.

528
00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:23,281
I want to start right away
to search for the princess.

529
00:53:34,468 --> 00:53:35,479
Okay.

530
00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:40,452
You will be stripped of your position
leader of the Wakanda military

531
00:53:40,476 --> 00:53:44,462
and your status as a warrior.

532
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:51,042
May I speak, Your Highness?

533
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,971
Yes, you can talk.

534
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:55,468
I beg you...

535
00:53:56,478 --> 00:53:58,478
I have given everything.

536
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:03,439
Let me die to save
my country and my throne.

537
00:54:03,463 --> 00:54:05,443
I am begging you.

538
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:09,479
- Let me make amends.
- Make amends?

539
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:13,445
I don't know if my daughter
is she alive or dead

540
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:17,462
Perhaps we are too hasty.

541
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:23,442
She raised her spear against
of her husband for the sake of Wakanda.

542
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:29,440
And where is her husband now?
A place he can go.

543
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:33,448
Mine is with the ancestors.

544
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:38,447
I am the queen of more
powerful nation in the world,

545
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:42,443
and i lost my whole family!

546
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:45,476
Didn't I give everything?

547
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,476
Get up, general.

548
00:55:02,473 --> 00:55:08,451
I stood up for you when
killmonger took the throne.

549
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:12,447
But you and the board members
council together you supported him,

550
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:17,441
when I ran to Jabari for protection.

551
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:21,480
I warned you not to take it
my daughter on this mission,

552
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,452
and you lost her.

553
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:28,470
So today you are done.

554
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:17,478
Are you here, Grio?

555
00:56:19,464 --> 00:56:21,448
Yes, my Queen.

556
00:56:21,472 --> 00:56:24,480
Were you with Suri when she was kidnapped?

557
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,445
Yes I was.

558
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:29,446
You can spot
the chemotherapy pearls?

559
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,410
We found bullets all over Cambridge.

560
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:34,845
The people of Wakanda
he was indeed in town.

561
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:37,474
But how did they find out
who made the machine?

562
00:56:38,137 --> 00:56:40,054
As these are extreme
confidential information.

563
00:56:43,463 --> 00:56:46,446
Got a new ringtone?

564
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,988
- I have to answer, boss.
- Leave the formalities now. Answer it.

565
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:56,674
Hello my love.
I'm with my boss.

566
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:59,439
Yes now
- Which just left.

567
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:03,257
I will work from home
and then I'll take a shower.

568
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:13,237
- Everett Ross?
- Queen Ramonda?

569
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,618
What do you do with the chemical?
suri's pearl?

570
00:57:15,745 --> 00:57:20,443
I didn't know it was hers.
I found them at the crime scene.

571
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,445
Do you have students at school?

572
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:26,440
Suri tried to save her,
but they have both been kidnapped.

573
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:31,442
Who was he kidnapped by?
SIA thinks it's you.

574
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:35,457
I'm afraid they'll find out how I drove
Shuri and Okoye in the right direction.

575
00:57:35,481 --> 00:57:39,454
I want to help them, but
I need to know what's going on.

576
00:57:39,478 --> 00:57:42,449
There is a new one
global power in the game.

577
00:57:42,473 --> 00:57:46,635
The country we are watching or do you mean someone else?

578
00:57:46,855 --> 00:57:51,352
I can't say much more now.
Please let me know if the govt

579
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:54,439
decide to act
based on her suspicions.

580
00:57:54,463 --> 00:57:55,479
Will do it.

581
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,377
Listen, if there's anything I can do
to help, tell me.

582
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:02,120
I owe Suri my life.

583
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:06,451
Grio, is Suri wearing her earrings?

584
00:58:06,475 --> 00:58:13,458
They were lost in the North Atlantic
but her captors spoke Yucatecan.

585
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,693
APPLICANT'S CAPITAL
"HAITI"

586
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,988
Welcome.

587
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:31,929
Do you want to speak to the manager?

588
00:58:39,168 --> 00:58:40,159
There she goes.

589
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,661
Very good...

590
00:58:50,173 --> 00:58:51,525
Good morning.

591
00:58:57,174 --> 00:59:01,039
Excuse me for a moment.

592
00:59:05,176 --> 00:59:07,149
Good morning.

593
00:59:07,173 --> 00:59:08,107
Good morning.

594
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:16,147
Lady Queen Mother...

595
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:18,889
Everything here is a lesson for children.

596
00:59:19,174 --> 00:59:24,315
They paint the walls, feed and care
the fish do whatever it takes.

597
00:59:24,515 --> 00:59:26,954
Some of my concepts are familiar

598
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:29,493
but you use
different material now.

599
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:32,891
Yes, we use what we can
to find here in Haiti.

600
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:38,185
We missed you at Tsala's funeral.

601
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:53,685
- Queen mother...
- It's been six years since you left.

602
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:57,623
I thought you would attend
at least at the ceremony.

603
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:06,730
I was afraid, like the funeral
would put a definitive end to it.

604
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:09,432
Nakia, daughter of Yaa.

605
01:00:11,093 --> 01:00:14,470
You will always be her daughter
Wakanda wherever you go.

606
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,021
You know death is not the end.

607
01:00:23,172 --> 01:00:24,363
Thanks

608
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:31,454
How is everyone at home?

609
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:35,507
- Suri was kidnapped.
- How why?

610
01:00:35,707 --> 01:00:39,266
You have infiltrated many countries before.

611
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:41,096
It has been a long time.

612
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:43,090
I was a different person then.

613
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:48,824
I need someone who can find her
and save her without being seen.

614
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:52,181
Who would dare
challenge Wakanda?

615
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:57,148
- Oh my god.
- Breathe.

616
01:00:57,172 --> 01:01:01,255
Don't ask me to breathe.
Where the hell are we?

617
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:06,162
- I am not sure.
- Oh my god, what is this?

618
01:01:06,186 --> 01:01:10,159
Their larvae emit light.
Just calm down.

619
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:14,018
There is no new black panther
where can you call

620
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:17,778
No. It doesn't work that way anymore.

621
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:20,164
Black Panther is in the past.

622
01:01:20,188 --> 01:01:24,173
Now that we've been kidnapped,
is there no black panther?

623
01:01:28,545 --> 01:01:29,619
Princess.

624
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:33,165
The members of the royal family

625
01:01:33,474 --> 01:01:35,765
here they wear traditional clothes.

626
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:37,648
Do you understand what he says;

627
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:45,582
- They made it for me.
- This is so bad.

628
01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:48,459
It's in every movie.
Princess Leia,

629
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:53,261
Belle from "Beauty and the Beast"
the white girl from "Indiana Jones".

630
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:56,182
You will be surprised to see what you need
to wear to the Warriors' Feast.

631
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:04,173
Come with me.

632
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:09,864
- You won't leave me here, will you?
- I'll be back.

633
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:14,421
I'll be back. Calm down.

634
01:02:21,188 --> 01:02:22,723
Do you want to eat;

635
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:30,188
{\an5}YUCATAN, MEXICO

636
01:02:37,168 --> 01:02:41,151
- Good evening lady.
- How can I help you;

637
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:44,299
My name is Maria Aldana.
I am a student of Merida.

638
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:46,554
I do not care.
Go away please

639
01:02:46,754 --> 01:02:50,679
Yes of course. I don't want you
offend...give me a moment.

640
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:53,493
My teacher mentioned a survey
to which you replied that you have met...

641
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:00,189
... an inconceivable man.

642
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:04,337
No one wants to talk to strangers.

643
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:07,177
- I'm begging you.
- Disappear.

644
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:11,022
I met him too.

645
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:27,148
Sometimes I saw a winged man

646
01:03:27,172 --> 01:03:31,188
in the beach.
We thought it was a soul

647
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:37,162
of Kukulkan, the winged one
snake god,

648
01:03:37,186 --> 01:03:41,152
which rules in him
the world and the under...

649
01:03:41,176 --> 01:03:44,188
I want to go to this beach.

650
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:50,147
I warn you.
Kukulkan was there a lot

651
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:52,165
before you and me

652
01:03:52,189 --> 01:03:58,180
Others sought him and brought him
in their hearts bad faith

653
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,890
and they never came back.
They disappeared into the depths

654
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:03,858
forever.

655
01:04:23,177 --> 01:04:26,170
Princess.
Welcome.

656
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:30,182
Please come closer.

657
01:04:37,188 --> 01:04:41,930
- This is beautiful.
- It belonged to my mother.

658
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:54,671
All artifacts
is from Central America,

659
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,965
mainly of the 16th century.

660
01:04:58,188 --> 01:05:00,977
Have you lived since then?

661
01:05:02,182 --> 01:05:04,442
Your mother was human

662
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,252
It was, but something else happened.

663
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:11,753
- How?
- How?

664
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:14,752
the important
it's not the how but the why.

665
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,185
{\an5}1571
ZAMA,
YUCATAN

666
01:05:26,466 --> 01:05:29,299
My mother's people
were evicted from their farms

667
01:05:29,704 --> 01:05:32,798
because of the Spanish invaders
who brought smallpox with them.

668
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:36,178
Hate for the language
and doctrine from another world.

669
01:05:38,124 --> 01:05:41,850
They had to face starvation,
war and disease

670
01:05:42,278 --> 01:05:44,182
My folks turned to Chuck...

671
01:05:45,177 --> 01:05:48,238
... the God of rain and wealth.

672
01:05:49,968 --> 01:05:52,105
Chuck showed us the way
of our spirit,

673
01:05:53,526 --> 01:05:55,372
how he could save his people.

674
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:03,506
Chuck gave them a plant that
grows on a blue stone

675
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:19,407
My mother was pregnant
to me at the time

676
01:06:19,616 --> 01:06:23,864
and he did not dare to eat
from the plant so as not to lose me.

677
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,189
No, I'm pregnant.

678
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:27,746
But the spiritual was reassuring.

679
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,640
Your child is sick.

680
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:40,968
This might save him.

681
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:45,091
Your child will be
the first born in our new home.

682
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:47,807
Think of this gift as a promise

683
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:51,372
that he will be our new king

684
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:02,162
Everyone got sick.

685
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:08,174
Thus their life and existence ended there.

686
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:22,586
The plant took away their ability
to breathe the oxygen of the land.

687
01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:25,998
But he allowed them to breathe
in the sea.

688
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:31,708
They settled in the ocean

689
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:35,175
away from wars and diseases.

690
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:39,085
Come on!

691
01:08:04,178 --> 01:08:06,899
That's where my mother gave birth to me...

692
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:10,177
...and I became the first man
who was born in Talokan.

693
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:15,162
The plant gave me winged ankles
and ears pointing to the sky.

694
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:16,905
I was a mutant.

695
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,187
I was flying in the sky.
But my age has slowed.

696
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:24,156
And I could breathe
the air of my ancestors.

697
01:08:25,169 --> 01:08:26,542
My mother was getting old

698
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:31,625
and mourned the life he knew

699
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:35,562
and died heartbroken.

700
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:42,304
She made me promise her
that I would bury her in her homeland.

701
01:08:47,178 --> 01:08:51,188
But I wasn't ready
for what I would see there.

702
01:08:57,169 --> 01:08:59,189
Whose son is this?

703
01:09:13,184 --> 01:09:15,511
Get ready!

704
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:36,570
You are the devil
Satan's seed.

705
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:40,445
A Spanish priest cursed me
as she was dying in my arms.

706
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:43,161
He called me...

707
01:09:43,185 --> 01:09:46,169
"The Loveless Child".

708
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:49,742
"Child without love"..

709
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:51,733
And from his words I got my name

710
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,153
"Namor".

711
01:09:58,177 --> 01:10:02,161
Because I had no love
for the world of earth.

712
01:10:02,185 --> 01:10:05,153
Why are you telling me all this?

713
01:10:05,177 --> 01:10:10,155
To understand why you should
to kill the researcher.

714
01:10:10,355 --> 01:10:11,890
What if we take her to Wakanda?

715
01:10:13,169 --> 01:10:18,549
Let us go. I give you my word
that the girl will stay in my hometown.

716
01:10:18,787 --> 01:10:21,601
- I can't risk it.
- Then hold me.

717
01:10:23,183 --> 01:10:26,153
I would like to see your nation.

718
01:10:26,177 --> 01:10:29,471
You can't go like that.

719
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:34,615
Your body will go into immediate shock.

720
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:36,960
Your blood will be poisoned

721
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:41,349
and the water pressure will break
every bone in your body,

722
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:47,193
or you can wear a suit.
We have many options.

723
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:52,187
Stay close to me.

724
01:11:56,168 --> 01:11:58,170
Namor, wait!

725
01:13:08,188 --> 01:13:12,170
{\an5}TALOCAN CAPITAL

726
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:02,180
Hello.

727
01:14:31,171 --> 01:14:35,441
It is very beautiful.
It is made of vibranium.

728
01:14:35,641 --> 01:14:41,086
Yes, to the depths of the ocean I brought
the sun to my people.

729
01:14:43,168 --> 01:14:46,665
I know you want me not to kill
the scientist

730
01:14:47,377 --> 01:14:49,198
But now you see
what should i protect

731
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:18,754
Your hunch was right, Nakia
I spotted Suri's earrings.

732
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:55,177
The signal originates
from an underwater cave

733
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:58,749
in depth approx
140 meters from the surface.

734
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:04,154
Queen, I found her trail.
It comes from an underwater cave.

735
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:07,787
If it's down there, I'm sure
that I will meet resistance.

736
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:10,676
How do you want me to act?

737
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:15,550
Take back the princess
by any means possible.

738
01:16:15,952 --> 01:16:19,416
I'll try to pull Namor out.

739
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,467
You are the first person from
surface that came to Talocan.

740
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,964
Please accept this
as a token of my gratitude.

741
01:17:07,587 --> 01:17:10,273
It is made from the plant
who saved Talocan.

742
01:17:12,596 --> 01:17:14,647
You are young, Princess.

743
01:17:14,847 --> 01:17:16,691
If you get old like me...

744
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:20,732
You understand that we all lose
everyone we love

745
01:17:20,932 --> 01:17:24,600
But when I lost my brother,
the feeling was different.

746
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:26,718
He suffered in silence.

747
01:17:26,918 --> 01:17:29,742
And when he finally asked me for help,
I couldn't give it to him.

748
01:17:30,599 --> 01:17:33,567
How does that make sense?

749
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:36,805
My ancestors gave
gifts and skills...

750
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:40,228
to help save
my brother and I couldn't.

751
01:17:40,428 --> 01:17:42,845
Why;

752
01:17:44,604 --> 01:17:47,590
I don't have an answer to this question.

753
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:52,054
As my ancestors used to say:

754
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:55,969
"Only the most broken people
they can become great leaders"

755
01:17:59,597 --> 01:18:02,120
I admire what you have done here

756
01:18:04,794 --> 01:18:07,046
and how you protect
your people?

757
01:18:07,594 --> 01:18:10,571
But as the princess of Wakanda,

758
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:14,575
I can't let you kill her.

759
01:18:14,599 --> 01:18:19,566
My nation will not rest
until I come back.

760
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:25,599
I'm not leaving without her.
We need to settle this peacefully.

761
01:18:29,593 --> 01:18:32,054
The issue is no longer about the scientist.

762
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:37,551
For centuries nations have conquered
and enslave people like us

763
01:18:38,592 --> 01:18:40,286
only for our resources.

764
01:18:41,589 --> 01:18:43,428
Since the day I buried my mother,

765
01:18:43,628 --> 01:18:48,067
I prepare my people
for the time they will come to invade

766
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:52,591
And this instrument
it's a sign that the time has come.

767
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:59,274
I need to know if Wakanda
is he an ally or an enemy..

768
01:18:59,587 --> 01:19:01,599
There is no middle ground.

769
01:19:03,595 --> 01:19:07,578
So you plan to start
war all over the world...

770
01:19:07,602 --> 01:19:12,566
and you want wakanda to help you?
This is madness.

771
01:19:13,258 --> 01:19:17,277
No nation would plunder
Wakanda if given the chance.

772
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:23,564
If we ally, we will protect
each other from the attacks.

773
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:27,605
Once they stop threatening us,
then we will eliminate them.

774
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:30,971
The scientist
will return to Wakanda.

775
01:19:31,686 --> 01:19:34,254
And what if Wakanda refuses?

776
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,017
The researcher will die...

777
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:41,521
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

778
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:44,315
- Are you going to attack my country?
- Yes.

779
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:50,641
Listen to me. Wakanda will not win
never a war against the Talokan.

780
01:19:55,234 --> 01:19:56,780
He wants to offer you something,

781
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:57,980
the Kukulkan.

782
01:20:01,606 --> 01:20:07,572
I heard you that night you were
with your mother near the river.

783
01:20:07,596 --> 01:20:10,588
You said you wanted to burn the world down.

784
01:20:16,594 --> 01:20:19,594
Let's burn him together.

785
01:20:25,994 --> 01:20:27,443
{\an5}CO
LANGLEY VIRGINIA.

786
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,277
Queen Raimonda refuses
to sell us vibranium.

787
01:20:30,589 --> 01:20:33,786
And now they kidnapped the young woman
who made the machine.

788
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:39,354
Sincerely, Riri Williams
he is a genius with good performance.

789
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:43,118
Wakanda recruited her.
With the program they created.

790
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,156
But you sent an army at night.

791
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:50,360
To arrest
the princess of a superpower.

792
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:55,937
The president,
he wants to attack Wakanda.

793
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,601
- What kind of aggressive action?
- Destabilization.

794
01:21:02,588 --> 01:21:06,658
Special Officer Ross
is the expert.

795
01:21:06,893 --> 01:21:08,363
What do you think, Ross?

796
01:21:08,683 --> 01:21:11,412
My sources tell me
that something else is involved.

797
01:21:11,727 --> 01:21:14,189
- Another nation?
- I do not know maybe.

798
01:21:14,389 --> 01:21:16,399
You have to give me
enough time to investigate it.

799
01:21:16,516 --> 01:21:19,598
Otherwise, we will meet
at war against a country,

800
01:21:19,728 --> 01:21:22,097
which we cannot even comprehend
military capabilities.

801
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:28,124
- Ms. Director?
- He's an expert.

802
01:21:28,299 --> 01:21:30,793
I think the attack
in Wanda it would be wrong.

803
01:21:37,587 --> 01:21:39,589
- You are welcome;
- We have a problem..

804
01:21:40,599 --> 01:21:42,595
{\an5}KURAL BELCHO
KIP VERDE

805
01:22:00,602 --> 01:22:03,566
Is my daughter alive?

806
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,582
The princess is well and alive.

807
01:22:05,606 --> 01:22:11,653
He asked to be transferred to Talocan
and it will remain there for a while.

808
01:22:14,605 ​​--> 01:22:18,566
What can I give you in exchange?

809
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:21,582
- There is nothing.
- I have a different opinion

810
01:22:22,843 --> 01:22:26,357
Americans think
in charge of Wakanda

811
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,515
for the attack on the research ship.

812
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,375
Give me back my daughter
and the researcher

813
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,252
otherwise I will tell them about you.

814
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:44,367
If you tell the Americans about us,

815
01:22:45,983 --> 01:22:48,576
Or try to find us,

816
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:52,704
or see even a single ship
of Wakanda in the ocean...

817
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:55,156
i will kill the princess...

818
01:22:56,591 --> 01:23:00,817
and then I will come to Wakanda
and i will kill you

819
01:23:09,596 --> 01:23:11,572
So what happened?

820
01:23:12,977 --> 01:23:17,725
She wants to declare war on her world
surface. He asked me to help him.

821
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:26,585
We have to think.
We will never leave here.

822
01:23:38,594 --> 01:23:41,598
- Throw your spear!
- Kill the princess!

823
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:49,349
Throw away your knife.

824
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,503
You

825
01:23:51,706 --> 01:23:52,793
I'll kill you.

826
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,800
Let her go

827
01:23:55,028 --> 01:23:56,797
and I won't kill you.

828
01:23:59,597 --> 01:24:03,594
Suri, wave your hand.

829
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,605
Are you ok;

830
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:14,709
Give me your beads!
I can save her.

831
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:18,134
Suri, I don't know who she is,
but we must hear what he has to say.

832
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:21,152
Look, I hit her with a sonic.
it is lethal from this distance.

833
01:24:21,299 --> 01:24:22,930
he will not be able to survive.

834
01:24:23,235 --> 01:24:25,601
You do not understand.
This will lead to war.

835
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:12,597
- Have you knocked?
- No.

836
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,788
Thanks.

837
01:25:16,047 --> 01:25:17,232
You are welcome.

838
01:25:18,591 --> 01:25:21,597
Griot, take us to Wakanda.

839
01:25:25,595 --> 01:25:27,592
What happened my daughter?

840
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:31,552
Here come the Wakandans,

841
01:25:32,389 --> 01:25:34,325
and they took her.

842
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:38,604
Kukulkan...

843
01:25:40,604 --> 01:25:44,554
... can you save me?

844
01:25:58,328 --> 01:25:59,385
Passed away;

845
01:26:01,593 --> 01:26:02,601
Yes.

846
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:13,892
Rest in Peace.

847
01:26:16,717 --> 01:26:17,797
They came...

848
01:26:18,509 --> 01:26:22,342
while you were talking to the queen?

849
01:26:23,589 --> 01:26:27,242
She was not to be trusted.

850
01:26:27,587 --> 01:26:30,724
The princess saw our house.

851
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:33,441
What will stop them?

852
01:26:33,928 --> 01:26:36,128
to attack the Taloscans?

853
01:26:37,604 --> 01:26:39,732
I will stop them.

854
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:15,603
Rise up, Taloscans!

855
01:27:17,606 --> 01:27:19,986
Arm yourself, Taloscans!

856
01:27:25,451 --> 01:27:27,257
It blinded me...

857
01:27:27,557 --> 01:27:28,785
the hope...

858
01:27:29,315 --> 01:27:30,796
of the alliance.

859
01:27:32,589 --> 01:27:33,550
Me too...

860
01:27:34,527 --> 01:27:36,646
I put us in danger...

861
01:27:37,345 --> 01:27:39,133
all of you.

862
01:27:40,128 --> 01:27:41,107
The Taloscan...

863
01:27:41,551 --> 01:27:42,906
It won't change...

864
01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:44,593
his place, once again.

865
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,513
Namora.

866
01:27:47,785 --> 01:27:48,562
Let's go.

867
01:27:50,585 --> 01:27:53,603
When we're done with them...

868
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:58,882
they will never think...

869
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:01,029
again to approach

870
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:02,570
the Taloscan.

871
01:28:04,601 --> 01:28:06,652
Arm yourself, Taloscans!

872
01:28:18,308 --> 01:28:23,733
We're glad you're back, princess.
The town has been tense since you left.

873
01:28:24,303 --> 01:28:28,190
Reinforce sound barriers
in all directions.

874
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,137
- Princess?
- Neka.

875
01:28:33,295 --> 01:28:35,020
Thank the ancestors.

876
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:38,962
I just wanted to give you these.

877
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:44,310
No, keep them.
They may be needed soon.

878
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:47,261
Is that where you got it from?

879
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:54,282
It is true that you saw down
from the waters an empire?

880
01:28:54,306 --> 01:28:56,291
Yes.

881
01:28:57,295 --> 01:29:02,177
It's very nice,
but they are dangerous, Anika.

882
01:29:22,297 --> 01:29:28,093
So Miss Riri Williams?
What do you think of 'Wakanda'?

883
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:32,293
The stories don't do this place justice.

884
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:37,311
It's great here,
but I really want to go home.

885
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:41,539
- Be patient.
- Can I take my mother?

886
01:29:47,307 --> 01:29:51,700
The Princess was saved by Nakia.

887
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,307
Glory to Hanuman.

888
01:29:55,311 --> 01:29:59,288
The spy saved Wakanda, again.

889
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:04,312
The queen probably
he will reward her with exile.

890
01:30:06,302 --> 01:30:07,782
Okoye, welcome.

891
01:30:10,299 --> 01:30:12,293
Thank you my sister.

892
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:17,281
After the attack of Thanos,
you left without saying anything

893
01:30:17,305 --> 01:30:19,018
It hurt me.

894
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:26,271
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.

895
01:30:28,482 --> 01:30: 29,825
It wasn't easy for me.

896
01:30:30,294 --> 01:30:35,304
He was the King
and Black Panther, for everyone.

897
01:30:36,299 --> 01:30:37,695
But for me...

898
01:30:44,693 --> 01:30:46,533
... was everything.

899
01:30:47,313 --> 01:30:49,857
My T'Chala.

900
01:30:51,293 --> 01:30:54,402
When he was taken from me so suddenly.

901
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:56,839
I had to get away.

902
01:30:57,793 --> 01:30:59,698
and pick up my pieces.

903
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:07,446
I couldn't go on with my life
as if nothing had happened.

904
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:26,630
We are under attack.

905
01:31:34,293 --> 01:31:35,311
Keep it.

906
01:31:42,282 --> 01:31:43,192
Let's help them!

907
01:31:43,392 --> 01:31:44,783
Are you ok;

908
01:31:45,305 --> 01:31:47,470
Griot, activate defense.

909
01:31:48,017 --> 01:31:50,843
- Suri, where are you?
- To the lab, I'm coming.

910
01:31:51,002 --> 01:31:52,301
Stay where you are, it's an order!

911
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:54,779
I'm with Anika, mom. We can
to provide air support.

912
01:31:54,846 --> 01:31:56,351
Anika, don't let her go
to leave the laboratory.

913
01:31:56,483 --> 01:31:59,299
Mom, I can't hear you.
You're on vacation. See you later.

914
01:32:01,841 --> 01:32:04,200
- Did you hang up on the Queen?
- I hung up on my mother.

915
01:32:04,374 --> 01:32:05,611
There is a difference.
Come on, lets go.

916
01:32:37,313 --> 01:32:39,313
Invaders!

917
01:32:45,305 --> 01:32:48,310
Mum! Mum!

918
01:32:51,749 --> 01:32:53,559
Turn back!

919
01:32:57,296 --> 01:33:00,048
Paramedics submit
in sound hypnosis.

920
01:33:02,305 --> 01:33:04,097
Take the child!

921
01:33:04,397 --> 01:33:07,293
- Close your ears, General.
- Yes, that's what I do.

922
01:33:53,304 --> 01:33:56,298
- Can I help;
- Come here quickly.

923
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:04,292
Warrior!

924
01:34:06,298 --> 01:34:08,481
Cross your arms, kid.

925
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,311
Nakia.
We're going to find your mom, okay?

926
01:34:28,302 --> 01:34:29,713
The fisherman!

927
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:36,940
We dropped the Palace defenses.

928
01:34:37,284 --> 01:34:39,238
The rest is up to you.

929
01:35:58,292 --> 01:35:58,808
Aid!

930
01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:00,530
Aid!

931
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:20,562
- He is very fast.
- And faster in the water.

932
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:50,300
- System Bypass.
- I'm not going to leave you.

933
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:09,302
- You see him;
- Yes, there it is.

934
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:24,690
Go away, my daughter.

935
01:37:25,299 --> 01:37:28,292
- What if I leave you?
- Run!

936
01:37:42,309 --> 01:37:44,294
Let's go now!

937
01:38:45,191 --> 01:38:46,276
Help the girl.

938
01:38:52,508 --> 01:38:53,635
This happened because of her.

939
01:38:57,291 --> 01:39:01,158
I'll be back in a week
with all my army.

940
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:04,630
Join us to fight.

941
01:39:04,757 --> 01:39:07,980
Or I'll wipe out Wakanda
from the face of the earth.

942
01:39:08,297 --> 01:39:09,369
Come my queen!

943
01:39:11,058 --> 01:39:11,580
Mother.

944
01:39:12,086 --> 01:39:13,016
Hold her back!

945
01:39:13,116 --> 01:39:13,792
Mother.

946
01:39:14,593 --> 01:39:16,107
Bury your dead.

947
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:19,777
And mourn those you lost.

948
01:39:22,297 --> 01:39:24,045
You are the queen now.

949
01:39:29,314 --> 01:39:32,307
Let me! Mum!

950
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:44,312
Mum!

951
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:48,249
Wake up my queen.

952
01:39:49,307 --> 01:39:51,234
Let me try.

953
01:39:53,306 --> 01:39:56,303
Help her!
Mum.

954
01:39:59,299 --> 01:40:01,275
Wake up!

955
01:40:01,299 --> 01:40:03,311
Passed away.

956
01:40:46,312 --> 01:40:52,023
Condolences from the country
of Jabari for your loss.

957
01:40:58,307 --> 01:41:04,301
You must mourn accordingly
with ancestral rites.

958
01:41:07,058 --> 01:41:09,608
- Don't bother with the techniques.
- Why are you here;

959
01:41:11,926 --> 01:41:17,336
I promised your brother that I would
I would give you advice and protect you.

960
01:41:19,308 --> 01:41:22,303
But now I need it
your advice today.

961
01:41:25,309 --> 01:41:29,676
The elders of your tribe
they came to me with a proposal.

962
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:35,538
They want to evacuate the city
and set up camp at Jabari.

963
01:41:35,738 --> 01:41:39,055
And now you want him to listen
the opinion of a little girl.

964
01:41:39,255 --> 01:41:41,772
To mock tradition?

965
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:47,301
The world...

966
01:41:48,303 --> 01:41:54,938
The world has deprived you of much.
You can no longer be considered a little girl.

967
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:03,086
It is in the interest of my people
to know which option you prefer.

968
01:42:04,306 --> 01:42:07,290
The elders are desperate.

969
01:42:07,314 --> 01:42:10,303
The city is vulnerable.

970
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:17,304
If you help them,
they will owe you a lot.

971
01:42:19,308 --> 01:42:22,298
And what does your heart say?

972
01:42:24,314 --> 01:42:27,306
Where does it close?

973
01:42:28,311 --> 01:42:32,058
I just buried the last one
person who knew me well.

974
01:42:35,298 --> 01:42:37,310
My heart is buried with her.

975
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:18,318
The oil is about to spoil.

976
01:43:18,447 --> 01:43:21,370
- What are you doing here;
- I am hungry. And...

977
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:25,278
A tragedy struck the international community.
Sources can confirm,

978
01:43:25,302 --> 01:43:28,849
the death of Queen Raimonda,
Lumumba's daughter.

979
01:43:29,293 --> 01:43:31,125
The Western Allies blame...

980
01:43:31,297 --> 01:43:33,431
civil strife...
as a possible cause of death...

981
01:43:35,298 --> 01:43:38,174
So, do you have any comments?

982
01:43:40,627 --> 01:43:43,562
I wonder what else
your friends are hiding from you.

983
01:43:44,109 --> 01:43:45,556
What are you talking about;

984
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:49,434
I don't have any unauthorized ones
contact with the kingdom of Wakanda'

985
01:43:52,084 --> 01:43:53,434
What about beads?

986
01:43:54,305 --> 01:43:57,201
- Here you go;
- The beads?

987
01:43:57,674 --> 01:44:00,271
There is an interception
before you deny anything.

988
01:44:00,295 --> 01:44:03,794
I am aware of every conversation...

989
01:44:04,061 --> 01:44:07,339
that you had between and the call,
that you committed treason with the queen.

990
01:44:07,888 --> 01:44:08,781
May he rest in peace.

991
01:44:09,203 --> 01:44:11,445
But that's good, good for us.

992
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:16,103
The Wakandans saved my life.
They are good people.

993
01:44:16,613 --> 01:44:20,134
Have you thought about what they could do?

994
01:44:20,764 --> 01:44:22,224
Have you thought about what we do?

995
01:44:22,376 --> 01:44:25,422
If the United States were alone
country in the world with vibranium?

996
01:44:26,445 --> 01:44:29,912
I have actually dreamed of this.

997
01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:36,335
- Put, please...
- Director de Fontaine.

998
01:44:39,557 --> 01:44:42,499
Your mother protected me
as if I were her child.

999
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,227
It's the least I can do
to try to return the favor.

1000
01:44:47,599 --> 01:44:51,643
- We need to weaken him.
- Even if it weakens...

1001
01:44:51,724 --> 01:44:52,901
the problem remains.

1002
01:44:53,201 --> 01:44:56,657
Black Panther ever
he didn't let Wakanda down.

1003
01:44:56,957 --> 01:44:58,603
Didn't you say Black Panther left?

1004
01:45:08,591 --> 01:45:10,501
My brother is dead.

1005
01:45:12,338 --> 01:45:14,588
But that doesn't mean
that the Black Panther is gone.

1006
01:45:32,584 --> 01:45:37,090
Griot, start benchmarking.

1007
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:40,491
to make an artificial parasite

1008
01:45:42,597 --> 01:45:45,570
to put it in the fibers of the bracelet.

1009
01:45:45,594 --> 01:45:47,032
Yes, Princess.

1010
01:45:49,606 --> 01:45:53,242
Since these were cultivated
in vibranium-rich soil.

1011
01:45:53,606 --> 01:45:57,898
There may be similarities between
that we can take advantage of.

1012
01:45:58,098 --> 01:45:59,598
As you wish Princess.

1013
01:46:04,146 --> 01:46:07,758
- Upload my brother's DNA too.
- Uploading it now.

1014
01:46:39,269 --> 01:46:40,361
Why don't they look alike?

1015
01:46:40,583 --> 01:46:42,734
The physiology is completely different.

1016
01:46:43,261 --> 01:46:45,775
None of them fly either
she has pointy ears like him.

1017
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:49,349
The women who guarded us
they put water in their mouths and throats.

1018
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,280
That's what they did.

1019
01:46:51,558 --> 01:46:53,932
There are many organizations
which do not need gills

1020
01:46:54,078 --> 01:46:56,728
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1021
01:46:57,137 --> 01:47:02,240
For example the jellyfish.
Absorbs oxygen through the skin.

1022
01:47:04,036 --> 01:47:05,605
This process is called diffusion.

1023
01:47:30,685 --> 01:47:34,806
Every day that goes by without us choosing
some area is a wasted day.

1024
01:47:35,045 --> 01:47:38,349
We have to deal with Namor
before bringing his warriors here.

1025
01:47:38,613 --> 01:47:41,232
How do you treat a person?
who has so much power?

1026
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:45,040
In the attack before the plane was shot down,
went back into the water.

1027
01:47:45,574 --> 01:47:47,180
Maybe he can draw power from her?

1028
01:47:47,406 --> 01:47:50,684
It breathes air and absorbs
oxygen from water.

1029
01:47:51,317 --> 01:47:53,940
If we find a way to keep him
dry will not be strong.

1030
01:47:54,349 --> 01:47:55,719
This is.

1031
01:47:55,919 --> 01:48:00,545
Grio, we have to move
the battle in a steam room.

1032
01:48:00,745 --> 01:48:03,571
- This happens;
- Yes, it is possible.

1033
01:48:03,771 --> 01:48:06,576
You will help us trap him.

1034
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,382
Please show the missus
Williams her workplace.

1035
01:48:09,939 --> 01:48:10,766
Please come from here.

1036
01:48:14,583 --> 01:48:17,237
How old were you when you did?
your first machine?

1037
01:48:17,437 --> 01:48:18,528
Three years old.

1038
01:48:18,781 --> 01:48:22,369
My stepfather was a car mechanic
and he wanted to build airplanes.

1039
01:48:22,618 --> 01:48:25,317
He gave me tools
and let me work.

1040
01:48:28,589 --> 01:48:32,751
- Who taught you?
- My big brother.

1041
01:48:35,585 --> 01:48:39,105
I was the tip of the spear
of the Wakanda military.

1042
01:48:39,435 --> 01:48:41,788
This doesn't suit me at all.

1043
01:48:41,988 --> 01:48:46,805
Besides, I'm a citizen now.
I surrendered my gun.

1044
01:48:47,303 --> 01:48:49,429
I also made you a new spear.

1045
01:48:50,597 --> 01:48:53,301
- New;
- Yes.

1046
01:48:53,603 --> 01:48:58,331
- And what did you call this thing?
- The Midnight Angel.

1047
01:48:58,928 --> 01:49:02,435
- The Midnight Angel?
- Listen to me, Okoya.

1048
01:49:02,635 --> 01:49:07,987
It has potential. Sister,
You must be ready when I call you.

1049
01:49:09,822 --> 01:49:10,606
I am begging you.

1050
01:49:14,603 --> 01:49:17,964
- Suri.
- Yes?

1051
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:21,600
How many of these did you make?

1052
01:49:23,585 --> 01:49:25,581
I was looking for you in Jabari barracks.

1053
01:49:25,781 --> 01:49:30,285
- I won't leave my house.
- You have a revolutionary spirit.

1054
01:49:30,485 --> 01:49:33,592
- Why did you join the warriors?
- Why are you interested;

1055
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,678
I still have the desire to fight.

1056
01:49:43,878 --> 01:49:50,445
Tell me, Anika, daughter of Kiana,
do you still have the will to fight?

1057
01:49:50,745 --> 01:49:52,596
What do you have in mind;

1058
01:50:16,605 --> 01:50:21,884
Grio, what's the success rate?

1059
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:24,621
98.7%, Princess.

1060
01:50:25,228 --> 01:50:27,887
Would you like me to print?
the heart shaped herb?

1061
01:50:30,605 --> 01:50:33,594
Hello, Suri.

1062
01:50:34,907 --> 01:50:37,224
I thought you were going back to Haiti.

1063
01:50:37,597 --> 01:50:39,956
I'm still Wakandan.

1064
01:50:43,972 --> 01:50:48,879
So that's what you're working on.

1065
01:50:49,588 --> 01:50:50,573
Yes.

1066
01:50:50,597 --> 01:50:52,968
What do you have here now?

1067
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:58,579
It's an opportunity for Wakanda to have
back her patron.

1068
01:50:59,587 --> 01:51:03,780
This will be the greatest gift

1069
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:07,601
and from the discovery of Basinga.

1070
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:14,560
We'll find out soon enough.
Come.

1071
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,831
- Gray?
- Yes, Princess.

1072
01:51:19,031 --> 01:51:20,031
Print it out.

1073
01:51:23,595 --> 01:51:27,587
- How will we know if it worked or not?
- It will shine!

1074
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:37,949
You did it!

1075
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:45,550
Let's not light incense
about the ancestors?

1076
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:49,387
Only the Goddess Bast knows how they got there
the ancestors in this workshop.

1077
01:51:58,604 --> 01:52:02,200
- Surely I won't bury you?
- Yes.

1078
01:52:02,946 --> 01:52:07,049
I want you to be able to reach
in my chest if I have a seizure.

1079
01:52:07,377 --> 01:52:09,206
Failure;

1080
01:52:09,605 --> 01:52:12,868
He's kidding, right?

1081
01:52:14,601 --> 01:52:16,113
So;

1082
01:52:21,994 --> 01:52:25,250
Allow me to leave this
the heart-shaped herb

1083
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:28,692
to give you
the power of the Black Panther

1084
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:31,774
and take you to the Realm of the Ancestors.

1085
01:52:34,138 --> 01:52:35,177
Raimonda

1086
01:52:35,724 --> 01:52:40,591
please come to your daughter.

1087
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:51,597
Mother;

1088
01:54:04,591 --> 01:54:08,019
- Ticks?
- Cousin;

1089
01:54:08,676 --> 01:54:09,284
How;

1090
01:54:09,484 --> 01:54:12,439
The important thing is not
the how but the why, right?

1091
01:54:13,594 --> 01:54:16,620
- You chose me.
- No, I didn't.

1092
01:54:17,332 --> 01:54:18,686
I would never choose you.

1093
01:54:18,886 --> 01:54:22,318
- Why did you take the herb?
- To see my family.

1094
01:54:22,576 --> 01:54:23,431
No, that's nonsense.

1095
01:54:23,631 --> 01:54:26,999
You didn't think that the Ancestral Kingdom
it would be real, right?

1096
01:54:30,267 --> 01:54:33,378
- No.
- Then why did you take it?

1097
01:54:35,419 --> 01:54:36,607
You don't have to lie to me.

1098
01:54:36,807 --> 01:54:40,628
- To become strong.
- Get stronger why?

1099
01:54:42,601 --> 01:54:47,592
You see; We look alike
more than you think.

1100
01:54:49,926 --> 01:54:51,943
You took it to get revenge
the ancestors.

1101
01:54:52,134 --> 01:54:53,329
I'm not like you.

1102
01:54:53,605 --> 01:54:55,911
You got it for yourself.
You consume the potion and burn the rest.

1103
01:54:56,566 --> 01:54:58,006
Then you destroyed what was left.

1104
01:54:58,604 --> 01:55:03,365
An unworthy king
who is afraid of being replaced.

1105
01:55:04,402 --> 01:55:05,423
A coward.

1106
01:55:05,623 --> 01:55:09,352
I had the courage to do what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1107
01:55:10,811 --> 01:55:14,403
How many people have I protected from you?
in Wakanda before I ascended the throne.

1108
01:55:15,587 --> 01:55:21,299
Panthers were cowards before me
and before T'Challa.

1109
01:55:21,467 --> 01:55:24,567
Don't mention my brother.
He's dead because of you.

1110
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:28,563
Burn the herb,
leaving us vulnerable.

1111
01:55:28,587 --> 01:55:33,573
Namor came and killed my mother.
You are responsible for her death.

1112
01:55:33,597 --> 01:55:39,563
Do not blame me.
And don't underestimate your mother.

1113
01:55:39,587 --> 01:55:43,605
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young woman from the lost tribe.

1114
01:55:44,585 --> 01:55:48,564
Your father was a hypocrite.

1115
01:55:48,588 --> 01:55:53,603
He would have killed the girl.
He killed his own brother.

1116
01:55:54,583 --> 01:55:57,552
T'Challa was noble.

1117
01:55:59,583 --> 01:56:03,569
You let his killer live.

1118
01:56:03,593 --> 01:56:06,592
And you are here standing.

1119
01:56:10,598 --> 01:56:13,287
Will you be as noble as your brother?

1120
01:56:13,487 --> 01:56:15,368
Or you will do the right thing...

1121
01:56:16,733 --> 01:56:17,564
...like me;

1122
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:21,603
Are you ok;

1123
01:56:22,603 ​​--> 01:56:24,389
Are you ok;

1124
01:56:26,596 --> 01:56:29,584
Who did you see?

1125
01:56:33,586 --> 01:56:34,602
Nobody.

1126
01:56:37,593 --> 01:56:42,205
- What happens;
- I failed. Did not work.

1127
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:43,688
Shuri...

1128
01:56:45,603 --> 01:56:49,094
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1129
01:56:49,276 --> 01:56:51,615
I did everything I had to do.
I remade the herb.

1130
01:56:51,984 --> 01:56:53,904
- Okay.
- I just did the stupid ritual

1131
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:54,863
and what did i get?

1132
01:56:55,063 --> 01:56:57,779
- Why didn't they come?
- Just calm down.

1133
01:57:03,604 --> 01:57:05,598
Damn it...

1134
01:57:09,586 --> 01:57:11,586
Can I have it too?

1135
01:57:18,589 --> 01:57:20,579
I think so...

1136
01:57:20,603 --> 01:57:23,599
...that you will need a uniform.

1137
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:58,599
- Many people come from the city.
- We need more space.

1138
01:57:59,598 --> 01:58:06,023
You are visitors. It is incredible
what you can achieve with anything.

1139
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:32,597
The princess!

1140
01:59:05,606 --> 01:59:08,564
It succeeded!

1141
01:59:08,588 --> 01:59:11,586
Long live the Black Panther!

1142
01:59:28,604 --> 01:59:32,599
Namor believes
that Wakanda is weak.

1143
01:59:33,604 --> 01:59:36,589
He murdered our Queen...

1144
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:40,603
...And destroyed the capital.

1145
01:59:41,583 --> 01:59:44,580
He thinks we are vulnerable.

1146
01:59:44,604 --> 01:59:49,577
...but now it is
time to attack

1147
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:53,604
How; We don't even know
how to find him?

1148
01:59:54,584 --> 01:59:57,583
- We will bring Namor to us.
- Here again?

1149
01:59:57,621 --> 02:00:00,618
No, in a remote location.

1150
02:00:00,818 --> 02:00:03,784
Well.
Let's say it succeeds.

1151
02:00:06,284 --> 02:00:10,919
Who can fly and can
to be as strong as the Hulk.

1152
02:00:13,584 --> 02:00:16,104
...the right thing is to kill him?

1153
02:00:16,304 --> 02:00:20,572
We call for his death, when
his only crime was bullying.

1154
02:00:20,596 --> 02:00:22,569
What has changed, Lord Embaco?

1155
02:00:22,593 --> 02:00:26,401
His soldiers
they didn't call him General or King,

1156
02:00:26,562 --> 02:00:28,632
he was called Ku-kul-kan.

1157
02:00:28,832 --> 02:00:31,605
- What it means;
- "Winged Serpent Deity".

1158
02:00:32,585 --> 02:00:37,578
He believes that because we live in the mountains,
can't we read, books?

1159
02:00:37,602 --> 02:00:41,569
Elders, with your permission.

1160
02:00:41,593 --> 02:00:45,887
Would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku in private.

1161
02:00:47,203 --> 02:00:47,783
Okay.

1162
02:00:48,277 --> 02:00:48,855
Okay.

1163
02:00:55,589 --> 02:00:57,469
Namor isn't done yet.

1164
02:00:59,012 --> 02:01:01,845
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1165
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:04,366
Now is our chance
to defeat him.

1166
02:01:04,525 --> 02:01:06,394
- What are you afraid of;
- The war.

1167
02:01:06,594 --> 02:01:09,579
If they see Namor
truly as God...

1168
02:01:09,603 --> 02:01:13,242
if we kill him,
we are in danger of perpetual war.

1169
02:01:13,442 --> 02:01:16,581
So what; Life wasn't worth living
my mother's perpetual war?

1170
02:01:16,605 --> 02:01:23,590
It's definitely worth it.

1171
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:29,138
But that's not it
that he would like for you.

1172
02:01:33,606 --> 02:01:37,585
And that's not what I want...

1173
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:40,598
...for my people.

1174
02:01:50,588 --> 02:01:53,585
You're talking about my mother
as if he is still with us.

1175
02:01:54,594 --> 02:02:00,592
You talk about what she would want for me.
For hopes and dreams...

1176
02:02:02,604 --> 02:02:06,604
but she is dead.
Passed away!

1177
02:02:08,586 --> 02:02:11,605
Namor choked her in front of me.

1178
02:02:13,593 --> 02:02:18,602
So her dreams, her goals,
and her hopes...

1179
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:23,602
...they don't exist.

1180
02:02:25,589 --> 02:02:27,601
It doesn't matter anymore.

1181
02:02:28,603 --> 02:02:32,421
What matters is what I want,

1182
02:02:32,621 --> 02:02:35,588
and what I want is Namor dead.

1183
02:02:38,598 --> 02:02:41,587
And you will help me defeat him.

1184
02:02:47,601 --> 02:02:49,585
Understood?

1185
02:02:56,596 --> 02:02:59,584
We are leaving tomorrow morning.

1186
02:03:24,379 --> 02:03:26,393
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1187
02:03:28,392 --> 02:03:30,882
If we survive this,

1188
02:03:31,391 --> 02:03:35,114
Know you have one
home with me in Haiti.

1189
02:03:37,396 --> 02:03:40,394
hold my hand

1190
02:03:43,387 --> 02:03:45,391
Breathe.

1191
02:03:48,396 --> 02:03:54,387
Suri, be honest with me.
Who did you see when you took the herb?

1192
02:03:59,393 --> 02:04:04,710
If you go to war for revenge, you won't
fill the void you feel from the loss.

1193
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:08,376
It will only grow
and it will consume you.

1194
02:04:10,384 --> 02:04:12,380
He already has.

1195
02:04:17,973 --> 02:04:24,947
Ku-kul-kan, a new machine
detects for vibranium in the ocean.

1196
02:04:25,105 --> 02:04:26,079
Where;

1197
02:04:27,387 --> 02:04:31,008
{\an5}ATLANTIC OCEAN

1198
02:04:55,377 --> 02:04:56,393
Get out of the water!

1199
02:05:40,395 --> 02:05:42,381
For the Queen.

1200
02:06:56,383 --> 02:06:58,366
riri how are you

1201
02:06:58,390 --> 02:07:03,385
- Griot, can you send help?
- You finally asked me.

1202
02:07:14,396 --> 02:07:18,396
Come on, he's fast.
But I'm faster.

1203
02:07:37,397 --> 02:07:39,397
I got you.

1204
02:07:45,383 --> 02:07:47,259
It's up to you, Suri!

1205
02:07:56,181 --> 02:07:57,780
- Princess.
- No.

1206
02:07:58,367 --> 02:08:01,716
I am the Black Panther
and I came to take revenge.

1207
02:08:01,916 --> 02:08:05,381
The cells were activated.

1208
02:08:14,379 --> 02:08:17,381
What happened to you;
Would you like a glass of water?

1209
02:08:21,383 --> 02:08:24,880
- We have it!
- Namor has been arrested.

1210
02:08:25,347 --> 02:08:26,110
We're coming back.

1211
02:08:30,388 --> 02:08:33,386
Back to Wakanda!

1212
02:08:37,385 --> 02:08:38,391
We're leaving!

1213
02:09:03,389 --> 02:09:08,183
- What happens;
- They destroyed the sonic cannon..

1214
02:09:29,388 --> 02:09:31,382
This is not a good sign.

1215
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:08,223
The ship lost its energy
and we have significant losses.

1216
02:10:08,423 --> 02:10:11,392
- Okay!
- Panther.

1217
02:10:12,396 --> 02:10:17,388
The virus!
The time has come.

1218
02:10:28,387 --> 02:10:31,384
For Wakanda!

1219
02:10:39,392 --> 02:10:42,364
- Griot, damage report.
- Destructive.

1220
02:10:42,570 --> 02:10:44,523
His spear is crafted
from crude vibranium.

1221
02:10:44,723 --> 02:10:46,843
- The ship will explode.
- Take us to the desert.

1222
02:11:05,381 --> 02:11:06,386
No!

1223
02:11:34,395 --> 02:11:36,382
Sink the ship!

1224
02:12:03,393 --> 02:12:06,387
I'm holding you, sister.

1225
02:13:10,383 --> 02:13:12,110
Warrior!

1226
02:13:15,378 --> 02:13:17,782
You speak the mother tongue.

1227
02:13:17,982 --> 02:13:20,791
You can use it
to greet your ancestors.

1228
02:13:50,379 --> 02:13:51,586
Get off me!

1229
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:04,390
Well, come here.

1230
02:14:08,408 --> 02:14:11,585
You will pay tribute
to your ancestors.

1231
02:14:35,375 --> 02:14:38,370
Our ancestors will save us
if the princess doesn't hurry.

1232
02:14:38,394 --> 02:14:41,134
We might go find them.

1233
02:14:42,049 --> 02:14:44,394
Then let us take with us as many as we can.

1234
02:15:14,398 --> 02:15:17,395
It could have been different.

1235
02:15:20,398 --> 02:15:22,826
I need water.

1236
02:15:39,377 --> 02:15:43,398
Will you be noble like your brother?
Or will you do what needs to be done...

1237
02:15:43,646 --> 02:15:44,598
...like me;

1238
02:15:44,798 --> 02:15:46,210
I'm not like my brother

1239
02:15:47,379 --> 02:15:49,234
Namor will beg for mercy...

1240
02:15:50,393 --> 02:15:52,554
while I will be by his side
and I will watch him die.

1241
02:16:31,385 --> 02:16:34,401
King of the Empire

1242
02:16:36,624 --> 02:16:37,673
Wakanda Forever!

1243
02:18:26,376 --> 02:18:28,310
Suri.

1244
02:18:29,377 --> 02:18:30,559
Mother...

1245
02:18:32,392 --> 02:18:36,309
Show him who you are.

1246
02:18:43,377 --> 02:18:45,358
Surrender,

1247
02:18:45,382 --> 02:18:50,044
and Wakanda will protect
your seas and your secret.

1248
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:52,362
Surrender,

1249
02:18:52,386 --> 02:18:54,336
and your people will live.

1250
02:18:58,381 --> 02:19:03,691
We were thirsty for revenge.
We will not allow it to be conquered.

1251
02:19:12,386 --> 02:19:14,378
Ι surrender.

1252
02:19:39,379 --> 02:19:41,893
Tulscans!

1253
02:19:43,379 --> 02:19:45,228
Let's go home.

1254
02:19:45,428 --> 02:19:46,807
Our battle is over here.

1255
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:01,395
Wakanda Forever!

1256
02:20:02,375 --> 02:20:04,379
Wakanda Forever!

1257
02:20:47,965 --> 02:20:49,970
Thank you my love.

1258
02:21:18,964 --> 02:21:22,943
- Ready to go home?
- Only the police are waiting for me.

1259
02:21:22,967 --> 02:21:27,951
Do not worry.
But I won't help you with your lessons.

1260
02:21:27,975 --> 02:21:30,619
If you get caught, I can't help you.

1261
02:21:31,968 --> 02:21:34,952
- Did they say you wanted to talk to me?
- Yes.

1262
02:21:34,976 --> 02:21:40,882
Your outfit. It has a nice design, though
I can't let you take her.

1263
02:21:41,086 --> 02:21:45,946
Correctly. I think it is the least
that I could do.

1264
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:48,966
I want to show you one last thing.

1265
02:21:52,968 --> 02:21:57,438
It took me a while to find
all the pieces in the river but it was worth it.

1266
02:21:57,975 --> 02:21:59,943
How...;

1267
02:21:59,967 --> 02:22:05,967
It's my father's car.
We were working on it before he died.

1268
02:22:10,970 --> 02:22:14,900
- Are you sure;
- Yes, I will send you to Boston.

1269
02:22:15,297 --> 02:22:16,467
and it will be there before you arrive.

1270
02:22:21,959 --> 02:22:23,544
Come here.

1271
02:22:25,972 --> 02:22:29,957
Panther, the transporter
for Miss Williams, arrived.

1272
02:22:29,981 --> 02:22:32,610
Take care of yourself.

1273
02:22:32,961 --> 02:22:37,498
Are you sure you won't come?
to see the Bulls in Chicago?

1274
02:22:38,553 --> 02:22:41,974
Sounds nice, but
I have something to take care of.

1275
02:23:06,969 --> 02:23:11,422
Now I present to you
Princess Suri.

1276
02:23:11,622 --> 02:23:12,738
The Black Panther!

1277
02:23:30,962 --> 02:23:33,683
Black Panther sends greetings...

1278
02:23:35,229 --> 02:23:36,878
But he won't be with us today...

1279
02:23:37,078 --> 02:23:38,979
I Em' Baku,

1280
02:23:39,959 --> 02:23:44,951
Chieftain of the Jabari clan
and son of Wakanda...

1281
02:23:44,975 --> 02:23:48,978
I would like to participate
in the challenge for the throne...

1282
02:23:54,967 --> 02:23:56,915
What's going on, son?

1283
02:23:58,933 --> 02:24:01,957
All my life I wanted

1284
02:24:01,981 --> 02:24:05,870
to fight with you

1285
02:24:06,963 --> 02:24:11,948
but I think you have submitted
to the Wakandans.

1286
02:24:12,248 --> 02:24:17,191
Black Panther had a lot
good reason to kill me...

1287
02:24:17,663 --> 02:24:20,857
Why do you think he didn't?

1288
02:24:23,159 --> 02:24:27,216
The Black Panther
he is the strongest man

1289
02:24:27,616 --> 02:24:33,399
to the most powerful nation on the surface

1290
02:24:33,699 --> 02:24:36,678
But he has no allies.

1291
02:24:36,978 --> 02:24:41,962
And now he has the sympathy
from the people of Talocan.

1292
02:24:42,972 --> 02:24:45,583
With this alliance...

1293
02:24:46,681 --> 02:24:53,446
The Talokan will be stronger than ever.

1294
02:24:53,958 --> 02:24:57,953
the surface world
will attack Wakanda

1295
02:24:58,549 --> 02:25:01,559
and Wakanda
will ask for our help.

1296
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,322
Trust me!

1297
02:25:20,968 --> 02:25:23,962
- What the hell is this;
- Can't we go back?

1298
02:25:24,974 --> 02:25:30,098
- I do not know man. We'll lose an hour.
- Go see.

1299
02:25:33,973 --> 02:25:35,552
I will save us.

1300
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:39,965
A tree blocks the road.
What do you want me to do;

1301
02:25:52,976 --> 02:25:55,743
I like you in chains.

1302
02:25:56,859 --> 02:25:58,657
When have I never seen you like this?

1303
02:25:58,958 --> 02:26:00,974
- Very funny.
- Get out!

1304
02:26:24,804 --> 02:26:25,447
Thanks.

1305
02:26:28,827 --> 02:26:30,336
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

1306
02:26:35,179 --> 02:26:36,746
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1307
02:26:37,943 --> 02:26:39,432
Welcome!

1308
02:26:41,559 --> 02:26:42,664
I am glad to see you.

1309
02:26:43,731 --> 02:26:46,065
Everything is ready.
Just give me a moment.

1310
02:26:46,265 --> 02:26:49,457
In fact, I think everything should
to do it myself

1311
02:26:49,981 --> 02:26:51,920
Of course.

1312

{\an8}BLACK PANTHER
WAKANTA FOREVER

1316
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:28,044
Shuri...

1317
02:31:29,631 --> 02:31:30,864
Can we sit with you?

1318
02:31:34,564 --> 02:31:37,066
This is my son, Toussaint.

1319
02:31:37,974 --> 02:31:42,825
Toussaint, this is your aunt, Suri.

1320
02:31:44,449 --> 02:31:45,443
Hello.

1321
02:32:06,885 --> 02:32:09,180
We had said it would be better
to grow up here.

1322
02:32:09,722 --> 02:32:12,098
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1323
02:32:14,505 --> 02:32:19,833
Your father, he prepared us
for his death, right?

1324
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:30,347
But he didn't want us to come to the funeral.
He felt the time was not right.

1325
02:32:31,423 --> 02:32:33,959
So we did
our own ceremony for him.

1326
02:32:36,221 --> 02:32:38,729
- Did my mom meet him?
- Of course he met him.

1327
02:32:47,963 --> 02:32:50,446
- Nice to meet you.
- Also.

1328
02:32:50,646 --> 02:32:54,728
Toussaint is a nice name.
It has a rich history.

1329
02:32:54,963 --> 02:32:58,395
Thanks.
You are very good too. I think so;

1330
02:33:02,236 --> 02:33:05,126
My mom said you're good
in keeping secrets. Is true;

1331
02:33:06,364 --> 02:33:08,278
Yes, I can keep a secret.

1332
02:33:12,225 --> 02:33:14,047
Toussaint is my name in Haitian.

1333
02:33:16,966 --> 02:33:18,345
Who you are;

1334
02:33:19,384 --> 02:33:23,426
I am Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.

1335
02:33:26,835 --> 02:33:32,137
DEDICATED TO FRIEND BOBCAT
