<i>We come together today...</i>

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:56.784
<i>In dark times such as these,</i>

00:01:56.818 --> 00:01:59.687
<i>we must all remember</i>

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.658
<i>to look
to the Lord for guidance.</i>

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.494
<i>Submit yourselves,
then, to God.</i>

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:07.595
<i>Amen.</i>

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.329
<i>Resist the Devil...</i>

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:11.699
<i>...and he will flee from you.</i>

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:14.134
<i>I regret to say</i>

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:18.171
<i>I know the powers
of Satan firsthand.</i>

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:20.173
<i>Our very own daughter
was taken</i>

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.776
<i>by perverts and swindlers</i>

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.278
<i>and let fall
into a world of sin.</i>

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.413
Sheriff?

00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:27.749
<i>I hope...</i>

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:29.684
You ought to come take
a look at this.

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:05.486
My God.

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.327
Go easy on that stuff,
will ya?

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.163
You know what they say

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:51.466
about too much
of a good thing...

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:57.839
Give me some sugar.

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:11.619
You're special.

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:16.457
There ain't nobody else
out there like you.

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:21.328
Now giddyup.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.363
Time is money.
Everybody is waiting.

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:35.877
You're a fucking sex symbol.

Maxine.

<i>"The Farmer's Daughters."</i>

00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:17.044
Oh, hot damn.
Look-it, there I am.

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:18.479
Wow.

00:06:18.513 --> 00:06:20.681
Hollywood, here we come.

00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:22.750
No, ma'am.
We don't need Hollywood.

00:06:22.784 --> 00:06:25.553
These type of pictures
turn regular folks into stars.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.621
We're gonna do it
all ourselves.

00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:28.990
- Ain't that right, RJ?
- Yes, sir.

00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:31.492
Finally,
a level playing field for people like us.

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:32.627
I don't know, Wayne.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.428
Sounds an awful lot
like what you said

00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:35.930
about <i>The Topless Carwash.</i>

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:36.798
You remember that?

00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.332
Yeah.
And had the IRS not had

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.701
a goddamn personal vendetta
against me,

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:42.369
that would've panned out
beautifully.

00:06:42.403 --> 00:06:43.437
Uh-huh.

00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:45.807
Well, you know
I'm always game.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.340
My American Dream
is not unreasonable.

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:49.911
I just want a paid-for house
with a big ole pool,

00:06:49.944 --> 00:06:51.679
so I can float around
with my knees in the breeze

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:53.581
and tan these titties.

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:57.785
What? I was dealt a good hand.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.387
People spend a lot of money
to look at what God gave me.

00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:01.956
Be a sin
not to take care of 'em.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.057
Mmm.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:07.360
Yes, it sure would.

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:10.363
What about you, Maxine?

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.799
What's your American Dream?

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:13.801
Hmm.

00:07:48.603 --> 00:07:50.171
Hurry it up, we aren't
gonna be long in there.

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.845
If this kid I picked up
from the university

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.680
can put it together
like he says,

00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:01.916
our days of struggling
may soon be over.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:04.051
We do even half the numbers
of <i>Debbie Does Dallas,</i>

00:08:04.085 --> 00:08:05.553
I'm outta the red for good.

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.722
Hell, let's make
a picture a week, then.

00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:08.956
Patience, darlin'.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.126
I've been being patient
my whole life.

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:14.028
Well, that's the thing
about being patient.

00:08:15.897 --> 00:08:17.832
- I need to be famous, Wayne.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.600
I'm ready
for the high life.

00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:21.469
I'm sick and tired of
never gettin' what I want.

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:24.205
Well, you help me keep those
jokers in line out there,

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.140
I'll make sure you get
everything your heart desires.

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.808
You better have.

00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:29.443
I don't wanna worry
no more, Wayne.

00:08:29.477 --> 00:08:32.647
I deserve nice things.
I have cosmopolitan taste.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.815
- Don't I know it.
- I mean it.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:37.118
I want the whole world
to know my name.

00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:39.453
Like Lynda Carter
or some shit.

00:08:39.487 --> 00:08:40.621
Hey, everyone with a pulse

00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:42.823
is gonna lust
after a piece of Maxine Minx

00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:44.191
once they see what you can do.

00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:45.660
You know why?

00:08:47.495 --> 00:08:48.963
Why?

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.898
'Cause you got
that X factor.

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:54.035
Fuckin'-A-right.

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:55.503
Now, mosey on over there

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.538
and grab us some Wonder
Bread, Wonder Woman.

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:02.810
I don't
like his girlfriend.

00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:04.845
You don't like
anybody's girlfriend.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.715
She hardly says a word.
She just stares at everyone.

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:09.183
Well, she's shy.

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:11.686
Probably ain't never seen
nobody like us before.

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.854
People who stare
give me the heebie-jeebies.

00:09:13.888 --> 00:09:14.922
Better get used to that

00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:16.490
if you're gonna be
in the movies.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.802
Your little boyfriend
is cute.

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:30.838
You help him
with all his films?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.909
Sometimes, yeah.

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:39.613
Is that your boyfriend?

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.019
Sometimes, yeah.

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:49.924
Hey, how come you don't gotta
film none of this in order?

00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:51.258
Well, once I have it all
in the can,

00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:52.727
I can rearrange it
however I want.

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:54.261
No shit.

00:09:54.295 --> 00:09:55.796
I actually intend
on experimenting

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.764
a lot with
the film's editing.

00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:59.033
Giving it a certain sense
of the avant-garde,

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.201
like they're doing in France.

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:01.969
It's classier that way.

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:04.071
And it's a good trick
to disguise the low budget.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.040
All right,
let's slate it.

00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:12.580
And hit it.

00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:22.156
All right,
go ahead and fill her up.

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:29.163
You know,

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:31.265
if you tilt the camera up

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.300
from the nozzle...

00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:35.603
...it'll look
like he's using his cock.

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:57.858
See? I got good sense, too.

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:02.963
How come
we couldn't do

00:11:02.997 --> 00:11:04.698
any of this filming
in Houston?

00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:05.633
Ain't they got
plenty of farms?

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.002
Well, this county
raised property taxes,

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:10.771
a little bit of cash
goes a long way out here.

00:11:10.805 --> 00:11:11.872
Most older folks
can't compete

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:13.974
with the bigger outfits
no more.

00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:16.143
Now, we're not the only ones
trying to make a buck.

00:11:16.177 --> 00:11:18.646
<i>Kidnappers, murderers,</i>

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:19.980

Besides, it ain't
exactly something

00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:28.255
I wanna advertise around town.

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.657
You know how
some people can get

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.025
when it comes to sex.

00:11:31.058 --> 00:11:32.093
<i>Remember

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:34.128

- Oh, I got it.

Thanks to help
from yours truly.

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:44.371
- Got my smokes?
- Yes. God damn.

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:46.140
I'm just askin'.

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:47.908
Hey, if I'm gonna be
having sex for you,

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:49.376
I'm gonna
need cigarettes.

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:52.813
How's the script?

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:55.916
I don't know.
It's all right.

00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:58.352
Does it matter?

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.988
Hey, I don't wanna have
to wear a hard hat

00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:02.756
to make a livin', do you?

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:05.059
No.

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:06.193
Then don't you be
bringin' down the vibe

00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:07.328
of my investments.

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:10.064
Negativity attracts
negative results.

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:18.139
Winstons? You know
I only smoke Old Golds.

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.907
All they had,
Bobby-Lynne.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.243
That's it.
I'm calling my agent.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:40.462
<i>So, heed dire warnings,</i>

00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:43.964
<i>and repent
before it is too late.</i>

00:12:43.998 --> 00:12:46.267
<i>He may be a forgiving God,</i>

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:50.838
<i>but every man
has got his limits.</i>

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:08.122
Must be a bad wreck.

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:09.356
<i>Y'all stay safe out there.</i>

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.859
<i>I'll be right back
with some more golden oldies</i>

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:13.327
<i>right after
this commercial break.</i>

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.796
<i>93.5, KBQB.</i>

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:20.402
<i>...the 60th anniversary</i>

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.037
<i>...take place this Saturday.</i>

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.207
<i>Don't miss your chance
to tour the entire state...</i>

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.153
- What is it?
- Oh, don't look.

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.988
I hate blood and guts.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.525
Just when you thought

00:13:43.558 --> 00:13:45.125
you'd escaped
the slaughterhouse.

00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:46.961
Yeah.

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.395
<i>Now, that's a bonanza...</i>

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.831
Was that the...

00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:14.121
This is it.
Our own studio backlot.

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.023
Thank goodness.
I'm horny.

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:18.926
- You're always horny.
- No, not always.

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:23.197
It's perfect.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.399
It's really gonna
add a lot of production value.

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:04.038
Y'all stay put
while I go

00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:05.072
and handle business
right quick.

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:37.639
This wasn't I had in mind

00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:39.373
when I agreed to help out
on your film.

00:15:39.407 --> 00:15:41.208
Gotta start somewhere,
Lorraine.

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:43.110
RJ, it's smut.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.146
When did you become
such a prude?

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:49.083
I'm not.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.486
I just don't understand
why you're doing all this.

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:54.388
Because it is possible
to make a good dirty movie.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.335
Who's that?

00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:13.874
Yes, sir. It's Wayne Galleroy.
We spoke on the telephone.

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.089
Uh...

00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:31.925
Howard, right?

00:16:33.495 --> 00:16:34.995
You from the county?

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:38.198
This here's private property.

00:16:38.232 --> 00:16:41.436
Didn't you see the signs
down at the end of the drive?

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:44.271
Oh, easy, partner.

00:16:52.447 --> 00:16:53.681
Somethin's wrong.

00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:56.518
What'chu talkin' 'bout?

00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:07.327
You're trespassing.
The law says I can shoot.

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:10.964
Sir, I ain't from the county.

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.233
I'm from Houston.

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:16.103
We spoke on Tuesday.
You remember?

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:18.506
About y'all's boarding house.

00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:22.710
Oh, that's right.

00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:25.279
You're looking
for a place to stay.

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:32.587
Well, you never can be
too careful with strangers.

00:17:35.457 --> 00:17:37.559
You had me
pretty nervous there.

00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:39.561
It ain't even loaded.

00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:41.361
Most of the times,

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.565
just wavin' it around
is all it takes.

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.000
Oh, yes, sir.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.572
I keep the same thing
in my glove box.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:55.275
Wow,
that's one ugly sumbitch.

00:17:57.779 --> 00:17:58.979
What?

00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:00.615
He is.

00:19:23.798 --> 00:19:25.466
Hell of a spread
you got here.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.837
We like it.

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:46.554
You all right there,
old-timer?

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.256
I'm fine.

00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:10.812
- She ain't much.
- She's gorgeous.

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:19.754
Building was for soldiers
during the Civil War.

00:20:19.787 --> 00:20:22.457
They never saw
any action though.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.124
What about you?

00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:26.461
You serve?

00:20:27.495 --> 00:20:29.464
Flat feet.

00:20:29.497 --> 00:20:32.900
I did.
Two tours in South Vietnam.

00:20:32.934 --> 00:20:33.768
Had enough farmers

00:20:33.801 --> 00:20:36.136
tryin' to shoot me
for one lifetime.

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:39.574
Know what I mean, Pops?

00:20:39.607 --> 00:20:40.875
Oorah.

00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:49.584
Oh, careful, Howie.

00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:51.452
Hot damn,
that's my future fiancee

00:20:51.486 --> 00:20:52.487
you're eyeballin' there.

00:20:54.388 --> 00:20:55.423
Been a while

00:20:55.456 --> 00:20:57.190
since you seen
anythin' that nice?

00:20:57.224 --> 00:20:58.793
I don't recall
you mentioning

00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:00.828
you'd bringing
all these others.

00:21:01.996 --> 00:21:03.865
Now, about that...

00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:07.367
See, your ad said $30, but...

00:21:07.402 --> 00:21:10.438
I threw in a little extra
to sweeten the deal.

00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:11.739
I hope that's okay.

00:21:19.447 --> 00:21:21.516
I don't think
I like you, Wayne.

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:25.753
In fact,

00:21:25.787 --> 00:21:28.221
I don't much like the looks
of none of y'all.

00:21:28.255 --> 00:21:29.924
Now, my wife is next door,

00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:33.494
so I would appreciate
a little discretion.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.632
I give you my word.

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:41.502
You won't even know
we're here.

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:49.844
That was
some stellar negotiating.

00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:51.879
You really do have
a knack for business.

00:21:51.913 --> 00:21:53.280
You keep jawin', towhead,

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.416
I'll pull you off
the main stage for a month.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.617
Oh, but then, honey,

00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:58.419
you won't make
no money neither.

00:21:58.453 --> 00:21:59.554
How could you
just stand there

00:21:59.587 --> 00:22:00.788
and let him talk
about us like that?

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:01.856
Oh, calm down.

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:03.290
Ain't no need
to harsh the mellow.

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.759
It's harmless.
He's just old.

00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:06.293
His pecker ain't
probably been hard

00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:07.360
since before you were born.

00:22:07.394 --> 00:22:09.262
I'd hate people
like us then, too.

00:22:09.296 --> 00:22:10.832
He don't know
what we're doing, does he?

00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:15.837
So, church mouse,
you do speak.

00:22:21.308 --> 00:22:22.375
No.

00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:24.846
He sure doesn't.

00:22:24.879 --> 00:22:27.415
And I intend
to keep it that way.

00:22:27.448 --> 00:22:29.650
Now, I don't wanna give
the old codger a heart attack.

00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:32.487
Would you?

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.888
It's better to beg
for forgiveness

00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:35.322
than ask for permission.

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:36.624
You know what I mean?

00:22:38.993 --> 00:22:40.260
All right.

00:22:41.763 --> 00:22:43.598
That's enough jabberin'.

00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:46.067
I reckon it's about high time
we cut to the chase

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.969
and we give the people
what they wanna see.

00:22:48.736 --> 00:22:49.804
What do you say?

00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.006
Fucking finally!

00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:19.834
Okay. Now...
Now flip her over.

00:23:20.768 --> 00:23:21.769
Ooh!

00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:32.814
Oh, yeah.
Fuck me.

00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:34.482
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:35.550
That's great.

00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:37.418
Just scooch your chin up
for me.

00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:40.387
All right,
now slow it all down.

00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:42.757
- I wanna see the passion.
- Hey, kid.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.026
How about you just
point the camera

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:46.427
and stay in your lane.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.929
Let me do the screwing here.

00:23:55.603 --> 00:23:56.604
Yeah!

00:23:57.705 --> 00:23:58.706
Yes!

00:24:15.456 --> 00:24:16.624
Oh, my God.

00:26:21.215 --> 00:26:23.284
<i>Now,
I may not know shit from Shinola</i>

00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:24.151
when it comes to filmmaking,

00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:26.020
but I know for damn sure
people are gonna

00:26:26.053 --> 00:26:27.688
wanna see
what I just saw in there.

00:26:27.722 --> 00:26:28.756
Well, that's
'cause I'm not treatin' it

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:30.992
like pornography,
but as cinema.

00:26:31.025 --> 00:26:33.961
That's what these other
adult films are lackin'.

00:26:33.995 --> 00:26:37.098
Whatever you're doin',
you keep doin' it.

00:26:38.666 --> 00:26:39.967
People's eyes
are gonna pop out

00:26:40.001 --> 00:26:42.036
of their damn skulls
when they see this.

00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:43.237
We're gonna be rich.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.972
Feel how hard my cock is.

00:27:02.957 --> 00:27:04.291
Oh, sorry, baby.

00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:10.564
Don't be standing there

00:27:10.598 --> 00:27:12.299
like you're all proud
of yourself.

00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:14.602
I was born
for this line of work.

00:27:14.635 --> 00:27:18.272
Uh. You didn't
do nothin', dummy.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.642
It's called actin'.

00:27:21.675 --> 00:27:24.578
You good,
but you ain't that good.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.155
Fuck my pussy.

00:27:34.188 --> 00:27:36.223
Oh, you make me so wet.

00:27:36.257 --> 00:27:38.759
Oh, my God, you're so big.

00:27:42.229 --> 00:27:45.733
Aw, don't look so glum.

00:27:45.766 --> 00:27:47.968
You did just fine. Come here.

00:27:51.406 --> 00:27:53.307
I think I love you.

00:27:54.275 --> 00:27:55.976
Bless your heart.

00:29:33.974 --> 00:29:35.910
<i>And action!</i>

00:29:42.484 --> 00:29:44.018
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,

00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.288
but my van broke down
on the highway back yonder,

00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:48.255
and I was hopin'

00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:50.124
I could use y'all's phone
to call for help.

00:29:52.494 --> 00:29:54.261
Oh, my goodness.

00:29:54.295 --> 00:29:57.364
I'm afraid we don't own
a telephone,

00:29:57.398 --> 00:29:59.099
but my daddy
will be home soon,

00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:02.136
and I'm sure he could give you
a lift to town.

00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:04.738
Would you like to come inside?

00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:09.777
Much obliged.

00:31:40.502 --> 00:31:41.503
Hello?

00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:18.872
Hello?

00:32:48.703 --> 00:32:50.170
Lemonade?

00:33:05.252 --> 00:33:07.955
Sure is hot out there.

00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:10.991
You must be awful thirsty.

00:33:11.024 --> 00:33:13.293
Yes, ma'am.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.037
It's got a good taste.

00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:11.553
I should probably
get back now.

00:34:13.086 --> 00:34:14.456
My boyfriend gets real fussy

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.156
when he don't know
where I'm at, so...

00:34:29.537 --> 00:34:33.408
Come with me
before Daddy gets home.

00:34:53.628 --> 00:34:56.063
I was young once, too.

00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:02.169
It was taken
right before the first war.

00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:08.710
Believe it or not,
my Howard served in both.

00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:13.247
He survived the trenches
and Omaha Beach.

00:35:14.248 --> 00:35:15.450
There wasn't anything

00:35:15.483 --> 00:35:17.317
he wouldn't do for me
back then.

00:35:26.427 --> 00:35:27.795
That's the power of beauty.

00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:32.032
I was a dancer
in those early years.

00:35:33.333 --> 00:35:36.236
But then the war came, so...

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.407
Not everything in life
turns out how you expect.

00:35:48.115 --> 00:35:50.350
Such a special face.

00:35:56.123 --> 00:35:57.291
Beautiful.

00:35:59.727 --> 00:36:00.762
Look.

00:36:17.244 --> 00:36:19.714
I don't know
what's come over me.

00:36:19.747 --> 00:36:22.316
I've never quite
felt like this before.

00:36:24.419 --> 00:36:26.153
If Daddy catches us,

00:36:27.655 --> 00:36:29.757
<i>there's no telling
what he might do.</i>

00:36:33.393 --> 00:36:34.862
What are you doing?

00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.239
You should go.

00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:49.711
It will be our secret.

00:36:50.612 --> 00:36:51.846
What will?

00:36:52.847 --> 00:36:53.848
Shh.

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:32.720
Watch out!

00:37:34.455 --> 00:37:35.857
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.958
Sorry.

00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:39.292
The kid says
we're gonna lose the light!

00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:40.728
Well, come on now,
chop-chop.

00:37:53.508 --> 00:37:55.510
<i>You're not good.
Bluff it.</i>

00:37:57.612 --> 00:37:59.312
<i>You're a fucking sex symbol.</i>

00:38:05.553 --> 00:38:09.322
I will not accept a life
I do not deserve.

00:38:48.295 --> 00:38:49.329
Are you ready?

00:38:56.504 --> 00:38:57.572
Let's go to work.

00:39:21.596 --> 00:39:23.431
Coast is clear.

00:39:23.464 --> 00:39:24.866
- Right...
- Sound speed.

00:39:24.899 --> 00:39:27.001
Okay, we're rollin'.

00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:28.870
<i>Farmer's Daughter,</i> take one.

00:39:35.009 --> 00:39:36.010
Action.

00:39:39.981 --> 00:39:41.949
I'm looking
for the owner of this farm.

00:39:41.983 --> 00:39:44.619
His daughter said I could
find him in here.

00:39:44.652 --> 00:39:47.354
You must have been
talking to my sister.

00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:48.489
Sister?

00:39:48.523 --> 00:39:51.826
- She didn't mention you.
- Not surprised.

00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:55.429
She's always been jealous.

00:39:55.463 --> 00:39:58.666
I'm younger,
get all the attention.

00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:03.037
Daddy never lets her
leave the farm anymore.

00:40:04.772 --> 00:40:07.041
He's very protective.

00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:08.810
Well, I was hopin'
he could give me a ride

00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:10.912
back to town
before it got dark.

00:40:16.918 --> 00:40:18.820
We shouldn't disturb him.

00:40:19.754 --> 00:40:21.556
It would only make him angry.

00:40:22.957 --> 00:40:25.325
You wouldn't like Daddy
when he's angry.

00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:32.033
I could give you a ride.

00:44:07.982 --> 00:44:09.683
We talked about this.

00:44:12.286 --> 00:44:13.587
Howard?

00:44:14.088 --> 00:44:15.222
Please.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.698
You know I can't.

00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:26.333
My heart...

00:44:48.055 --> 00:44:53.027
<i>♪ They're gonna put me
in the movies</i>

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.630
<i>♪ They're gonna make
a big star out of me</i>

00:44:57.998 --> 00:45:00.034
<i>♪ They'll make

00:45:00.067 --> 00:45:03.370
<i>♪ Who's sad and lonely</i>

00:45:03.405 --> 00:45:07.074
<i>♪ And all I gotta do

00:45:07.108 --> 00:45:09.310
You were amazing out there.

00:45:09.343 --> 00:45:11.879
Now I know why Wayne
left his wife for you.

00:45:11.912 --> 00:45:14.115
So do I.

00:45:14.148 --> 00:45:15.116
Careful.

00:45:15.149 --> 00:45:17.718
Told y'all
she was somethin' special.

00:45:17.751 --> 00:45:18.919
X factor.

00:45:20.855 --> 00:45:21.856
Thanks, baby.

00:45:33.968 --> 00:45:35.002
What are you
looking at?

00:45:35.035 --> 00:45:36.370
Wait, come on now.

00:45:36.404 --> 00:45:38.005
No, Wayne.

00:45:38.038 --> 00:45:39.974
Anybody ever teach you
not to stare?

00:45:40.475 --> 00:45:41.675
It's rude.

00:45:42.877 --> 00:45:44.778
You got somethin' to say to me
or what?

00:45:44.812 --> 00:45:45.813
No.

00:45:49.049 --> 00:45:51.318
Well,
I do have a question.

00:45:51.352 --> 00:45:53.421
See,
she's interested, is all.

00:45:53.455 --> 00:45:55.256
What's on your mind,
church mouse?

00:45:55.289 --> 00:45:57.158
Isn't it strange

00:45:57.191 --> 00:45:59.193
watching her doin' it
with him?

00:45:59.226 --> 00:46:01.362
It's just business.

00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:03.764
As long as the camera
is runnin'.

00:46:03.797 --> 00:46:05.699
So the camera
changes things?

00:46:05.733 --> 00:46:06.800
That's right.

00:46:06.834 --> 00:46:08.002
It's not real life, Raine.

00:46:08.035 --> 00:46:09.404
It's just a movie.

00:46:10.371 --> 00:46:11.406
I know that.

00:46:14.008 --> 00:46:15.075
Just sayin'.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.178
What about love?

00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:18.480
What about love?

00:46:18.513 --> 00:46:19.880
Well, don't y'all
believe in it?

00:46:19.914 --> 00:46:21.449
Of course we believe in love.

00:46:21.483 --> 00:46:22.783
How can you love someone

00:46:22.816 --> 00:46:24.185
and still be
with other people?

00:46:24.218 --> 00:46:25.052
You think we don't have

00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:26.720
no morals or somethin',
is that it?

00:46:26.754 --> 00:46:28.856
No. No, I just...

00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:31.392
Take it from me,
letting outdated traditions

00:46:31.426 --> 00:46:33.495
control how you live your
life will get you nowhere.

00:46:33.528 --> 00:46:34.496
I don't know about you,
but I got

00:46:34.529 --> 00:46:36.797
better places to be
than where I came from.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:37.965
Amen to that.

00:46:37.998 --> 00:46:39.900
And besides,
it's just sex.

00:46:39.934 --> 00:46:40.968
You can decide
who you wanna love,

00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:42.269
but not who you wanna screw.

00:46:42.303 --> 00:46:44.338
Attraction's
out of our control.

00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:47.074
It ain't healthy keeping those
feelings locked away inside.

00:46:47.107 --> 00:46:47.975
I seen you sneaking

00:46:48.008 --> 00:46:50.478
a few long peeks
at Jackson over here.

00:46:50.512 --> 00:46:53.314
- No, I... I wasn't looking...
- It's okay.

00:46:53.347 --> 00:46:54.815
He don't mind none.

00:46:54.848 --> 00:46:56.050
She's right.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:57.985
I don't mind.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.254
No offense.

00:47:00.287 --> 00:47:02.424
Everybody likes sex.

00:47:02.457 --> 00:47:03.958
It's a gas.

00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:06.260
We're just not afraid
to admit it.

00:47:06.293 --> 00:47:08.996
Queer, straight,
Black, white...

00:47:09.029 --> 00:47:10.931
It's all disco.

00:47:10.965 --> 00:47:13.167
You know why?
Because one day,

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.302
we're gonna be too old
to fuck.

00:47:15.336 --> 00:47:17.771
And life's too short,
if you ask me.

00:47:17.805 --> 00:47:19.306
Roger that.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.275
The fact
of the truth of the matter is,

00:47:21.308 --> 00:47:22.943
we turn folks on.

00:47:25.145 --> 00:47:28.015
- And that scares 'em.
- They can't look away neither.

00:47:28.048 --> 00:47:29.984
That's right.

00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:32.554
We're like a foxy car wreck.

00:47:32.587 --> 00:47:34.221
Which is how I know

00:47:34.255 --> 00:47:37.157
that this new home video
market is set to explode.

00:47:37.191 --> 00:47:39.494
Finally, people are gonna
get to see what they desire

00:47:39.527 --> 00:47:42.896
in the privacy of their
own homes, free of judgment.

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.332
We're gonna give that to them
before anyone else.

00:47:45.366 --> 00:47:46.468
Porn ain't only gonna be

00:47:46.501 --> 00:47:48.436
- for perverts no more.
- Aw.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:49.303
Toast to the perverts.

00:47:49.336 --> 00:47:51.406
They've been payin'
our bills for years.

00:47:51.439 --> 00:47:53.441
Hear, hear!
To the perverts!

00:47:53.475 --> 00:47:55.209
To livin' a life
of excess,

00:47:55.242 --> 00:47:58.879
being young and having fun
till the day we die.

00:47:58.912 --> 00:48:00.981
To the power
of independent cinema.

00:48:01.015 --> 00:48:02.850
To living life
on our own terms.

00:48:02.883 --> 00:48:03.917
And never accepting what

00:48:03.951 --> 00:48:05.953
self-righteous naysayers
have to say.

00:48:05.986 --> 00:48:08.022
Right on.

00:48:08.055 --> 00:48:10.391
I don't know
if I agree with all of that,

00:48:11.526 --> 00:48:13.495
but I did like
what I saw today.

00:48:16.897 --> 00:48:18.365
I didn't think I would,
but I did.

00:48:18.399 --> 00:48:19.567
Cheers to that.

00:48:21.235 --> 00:48:22.936
- You ready?
- Yeah.

I wanna do a scene
in the movie.

00:50:43.043 --> 00:50:44.044
What?

00:50:48.115 --> 00:50:49.484
I wanna be in the movie.

00:50:51.018 --> 00:50:52.219
No.

00:50:56.323 --> 00:50:57.492
Well, why not?

00:50:59.126 --> 00:51:01.195
Well...

00:51:01.228 --> 00:51:02.296
Because...

00:51:03.263 --> 00:51:04.432
No.

00:51:07.367 --> 00:51:08.703
Did y'all put her up to this
or somethin'?

00:51:08.736 --> 00:51:10.037
- No!
- Hey!

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.773
Take it easy.
They didn't do nothin'.

00:51:11.806 --> 00:51:13.373
Nobody put me up
to anything.

00:51:13.408 --> 00:51:15.309
I've been thinking
about it all day.

00:51:15.342 --> 00:51:16.376
And...

00:51:17.612 --> 00:51:18.580
Well, I'm young.

00:51:18.613 --> 00:51:21.315
And if we really are makin'
a good dirty movie,

00:51:21.348 --> 00:51:23.217
then I don't wanna
just carry the equipment.

00:51:24.586 --> 00:51:25.687
I wanna be in it.

00:51:26.621 --> 00:51:27.988
Well, you can't.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.091
Says who?

00:51:32.359 --> 00:51:34.496
It's my film, Lorraine.

00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:36.196
I mean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.165
We've already shot half of it.

00:51:38.198 --> 00:51:41.201
The story can't just suddenly
change midway through.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:44.304
Why?

00:51:46.139 --> 00:51:47.675
Because it just isn't done.

00:51:48.843 --> 00:51:51.345
What about in <i>Psycho?</i>
You love that movie.

00:51:53.615 --> 00:51:57.585
Well, <i>Psycho</i> is a horror film.

00:51:57.619 --> 00:52:01.054
And that plot was a MacGuffin
to build suspense.

00:52:01.088 --> 00:52:02.624
And I'm not making
that kind of movie.

00:52:02.657 --> 00:52:04.124
Oh, come on, RJ.

00:52:04.157 --> 00:52:06.360
Nobody's comin'
to see this film for the plot.

00:52:06.393 --> 00:52:08.429
They're comin'
to see tits and ass.

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.232
- And a big dick.
- Lorraine!

00:52:12.266 --> 00:52:13.367
It's the truth.

00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:16.638
Why not just give the people
what they're payin' for?

00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:19.072
Because I'm making
something better than that.

00:52:20.675 --> 00:52:22.610
When did you become
such a prude?

00:52:24.344 --> 00:52:26.714
All right, hold on.

00:52:26.748 --> 00:52:30.518
I am the executive producer,
which means I get a word.

00:52:30.552 --> 00:52:32.420
So, why don't we just
take a step outside

00:52:32.453 --> 00:52:35.322
before anythin' gets said
that someone might regret.

00:52:43.598 --> 00:52:45.567
You gotta back me up
in here, Wayne!

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.834
I mean,
this situation is fixin'

00:52:46.868 --> 00:52:49.269
to get outta control.
It is awfully close.

00:52:49.303 --> 00:52:50.838
Relax.

00:52:50.872 --> 00:52:53.106
Hey, what is it they say,
"Life imitates art"?

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.108
It's the other way around.

00:52:55.142 --> 00:52:56.209
Whatever, it don't matter.

00:52:56.243 --> 00:52:57.244
But you need
to listen to me, okay?

00:52:57.277 --> 00:53:00.615
Because you ain't been 42,
and I have been 23.

00:53:00.648 --> 00:53:02.182
And I'm gonna explain
somethin' to you

00:53:02.215 --> 00:53:03.685
about young women.

00:53:03.718 --> 00:53:05.285
Now, if she's serious,

00:53:06.588 --> 00:53:08.388
which I suspect she is,

00:53:09.624 --> 00:53:12.159
she's gonna do it
whether you like it or not.

00:53:12.192 --> 00:53:14.596
Now, you try to stop her,
not only is she gonna do it,

00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:16.831
she's gonna go on and do it
with God knows how many people

00:53:16.864 --> 00:53:18.265
in God knows
how many other films,

00:53:18.298 --> 00:53:19.734
and nobody wants that.

00:53:20.602 --> 00:53:21.636
The way I see it,

00:53:21.669 --> 00:53:23.605
you only got
one good option here.

00:53:23.638 --> 00:53:26.239
What, letting her get balled
by some man whore?

00:53:26.273 --> 00:53:27.909
Come on now,
Jackson is a professional.

00:53:27.942 --> 00:53:29.744
He ain't got no diseases
or nothin'.

00:53:29.777 --> 00:53:31.613
You just want more sex
in the movie.

00:53:31.646 --> 00:53:33.681
That ain't me, hoss.
She wants it, you heard her.

00:53:34.749 --> 00:53:36.484
Heck, if she does great,

00:53:36.517 --> 00:53:38.586
she gets famous,
maybe she'll take you with her.

00:53:40.354 --> 00:53:41.823
Wayne, you don't get it.

00:53:43.558 --> 00:53:45.860
Lorraine is not
like the others in there.

00:53:45.893 --> 00:53:48.161
She is a nice girl.

00:53:50.465 --> 00:53:51.833
I beg your pardon?

00:53:51.866 --> 00:53:53.835
No, I didn't mean it
like that.

00:53:53.868 --> 00:53:57.237
Oh, I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

00:53:59.206 --> 00:54:01.241
but ain't none of them
nice girls.

00:57:10.932 --> 00:57:11.966
To hell with this.

00:57:11.999 --> 00:57:13.366
She can have it.

00:57:13.401 --> 00:57:14.769
Let's see how far they get
without me.

00:57:14.802 --> 00:57:16.571
Good luck finding

00:57:16.604 --> 00:57:17.772
your own way out of here.

00:57:28.182 --> 00:57:29.382
What the...

00:57:42.496 --> 00:57:43.631
Ma'am?

00:57:54.842 --> 00:57:55.943
Are you all right?

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.555
Sorry, I'm...

00:58:18.466 --> 00:58:19.567
Ma'am?

00:58:35.082 --> 00:58:36.083
What?

00:58:37.585 --> 00:58:38.686
How come you just did that?

00:58:40.855 --> 00:58:43.724
Why won't you look at me?

00:58:43.758 --> 00:58:46.427
Look at me
like you looked at her.

00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:48.529
What?

00:58:48.562 --> 00:58:50.564
I can show you
what I'm capable of.

00:58:50.598 --> 00:58:52.500
Stop. I don't
wanna see it.

00:58:57.138 --> 00:59:00.207
Maybe we should just go
find your husband.

00:59:35.676 --> 00:59:36.711
Help me.

01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:39.834
<i>♪ Oui, oui, Marie</i>

01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:00.681
RJ?

01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:24.805
RJ?

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.008
Hey, hey, hey.

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:36.243
What's goin' on,
church mouse?

01:04:36.277 --> 01:04:40.415
It's RJ.
I woke up, and he was gone.

01:04:40.448 --> 01:04:41.248
I...

01:04:43.451 --> 01:04:45.219
You don't think he left me,
do you?

01:04:47.054 --> 01:04:48.322
Well, the van's still here.

01:04:49.356 --> 01:04:50.824
He's gotta be around
somewhere.

01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:59.033
Oh, hey, it ain't
like your dog ran off.

01:04:59.066 --> 01:05:01.368
He's probably just
processin' things, you know?

01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:03.270
Go on back to bed.

01:05:03.304 --> 01:05:06.840
I feel bad if I hurt him.
I don't wanna break up.

01:05:06.874 --> 01:05:09.276
Hun, you didn't
do nothin' wrong.

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:10.978
He'll get over it.

01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:13.347
He just needs
to toughen up, is all.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.982
Come on. I'll talk to him
in the morning.

01:05:16.016 --> 01:05:17.452
Will you
help me find him?

01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:21.388
Please? I'm worried.

01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:26.327
All right.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.029
I ain't gettin' in the middle
of no more of this shit.

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:40.542
RJ!

01:05:41.975 --> 01:05:44.111
Are you in here, brother?

01:05:44.144 --> 01:05:46.581
This ain't the way
to go about handlin' this.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.327
Oh, no.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.404
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

01:06:09.437 --> 01:06:11.338
What are you
doin' out here?

01:06:14.609 --> 01:06:16.444
I'm lookin' for my boyfriend.

01:06:24.051 --> 01:06:26.086
Have you seen
my wife?

01:06:27.154 --> 01:06:28.288
No, sir.

01:06:35.162 --> 01:06:37.898
Two keys to keepin'
a healthy relationship.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.002
Never let a good woman
out of your sight.

01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:45.407
Never mention her weight.

01:06:46.674 --> 01:06:48.242
How do you think
I've been surrounded

01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:51.311
by so many beautiful females
my whole life?

01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:53.914
There's an art to it.

01:06:55.282 --> 01:06:56.917
Just like business.

01:07:08.395 --> 01:07:11.633
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

01:07:24.679 --> 01:07:26.280
Oh, fuck me!

01:07:28.483 --> 01:07:32.420
Oh, shut up, cheeseburger!
Go wander into traffic.

01:07:32.454 --> 01:07:35.022
Oh, fuck.

01:07:40.795 --> 01:07:42.497
RJ, you in here?

01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.399
I stepped on a nail.

01:07:45.433 --> 01:07:48.168
Come on out and help me,
for Christ's sake!

01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:51.739
I'm gonna catch tetanus
from this shit.

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:04.051
RJ?

01:08:06.286 --> 01:08:08.388
Church mouse, that you?

01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:59.339
There's another light
down in the cellar.

01:08:59.373 --> 01:09:00.608
Can you go get it?

01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:05.345
Please. My wife is not well.

01:09:05.379 --> 01:09:06.681
It's very dark,

01:09:06.714 --> 01:09:09.417
and I'm worried she could fall
and break her hip.

01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:29.336
Downstairs.
You'll see my workbench.

01:11:16.511 --> 01:11:17.645
Found it!

01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:33.628
Hey, I'm locked in!

01:11:38.265 --> 01:11:39.366
Hey!

01:11:41.703 --> 01:11:44.539
Hey! Hey! Open up!

01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:53.441
What is it, baby?

01:12:54.909 --> 01:12:56.677
Thought I heard somethin'.

01:12:59.346 --> 01:13:00.648
Probably nothin'.

01:13:02.349 --> 01:13:03.851
Old habits die hard.

01:13:05.086 --> 01:13:06.554
Go back to sleep.

01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:09.657
Aye, aye, captain.

01:14:07.481 --> 01:14:08.816
Everything okay, Pops?

01:14:11.519 --> 01:14:14.455
My wife, she's gone missing.

01:14:14.488 --> 01:14:15.556
Missin'?

01:14:17.091 --> 01:14:18.826
She gets confused.

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.996
It happens sometimes
after dark.

01:14:22.029 --> 01:14:24.465
Lot of firepower
for a missin' wife.

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:27.034
It's for gators.

01:14:27.068 --> 01:14:30.404
I found her once
by the edge of our pond.

01:14:30.438 --> 01:14:32.039
If she was to fall in...

01:14:35.843 --> 01:14:37.011
Want some help?

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:42.483
Not for self
but for country, right?

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.688
Let me go and get my skivvies.

01:17:31.118 --> 01:17:33.788
I say we each
take a side of the perimeter.

01:17:33.821 --> 01:17:35.890
Cover ground quicker that way.

01:17:35.923 --> 01:17:37.892
I only got
the one light.

01:17:40.261 --> 01:17:41.662
No offense,

01:17:41.695 --> 01:17:43.964
but it's been a while
since you was deployed.

01:17:43.998 --> 01:17:46.133
I spent three nights face down
in a rice paddy

01:17:46.167 --> 01:17:48.235
scanning for land mines
and trip wires.

01:17:48.269 --> 01:17:51.172
Once a marine,
always a marine.

01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:53.674
If she's out here...

01:17:55.009 --> 01:17:56.243
I'll find her.

01:19:59.366 --> 01:20:00.901
I got nothin', Pops.

01:20:09.043 --> 01:20:10.244
Shit.

01:20:12.379 --> 01:20:14.381
What you doing
all the way in there?

01:20:29.063 --> 01:20:30.264
Oh, no.

01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:34.335
Pops, you okay?

01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:36.036
You in here?

01:20:37.304 --> 01:20:41.443
Help!
Help, somebody, please!

01:20:41.476 --> 01:20:43.110
Please help me!

01:20:44.979 --> 01:20:46.046
RJ!

01:20:47.948 --> 01:20:49.016
Help!

01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:29.256
Oh, shit!

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:32.159
You scared me, Pops.

01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:35.095
Once a marine,
always a marine.

01:21:36.163 --> 01:21:37.164
Well...

01:21:38.198 --> 01:21:39.933
Your lady ain't in there.

01:21:39.967 --> 01:21:42.936
I can't give her
what she wants anymore.

01:21:45.372 --> 01:21:47.475
You don't understand
what it's like.

01:21:47.509 --> 01:21:49.577
You can still do
as you please.

01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:51.378
Say what?

01:21:51.413 --> 01:21:55.115
The last bohemian
that stayed here was the same.

01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:58.520
Traipsin' around
in barely any clothes.

01:21:58.553 --> 01:22:00.455
Enticin' my wife.

01:22:02.424 --> 01:22:04.191
Yeah...

01:22:04.224 --> 01:22:06.628
Okay, well,

01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:08.329
we better get back up
to the house

01:22:08.362 --> 01:22:10.197
and find out what's goin' on.

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:13.000
I know exactly
what's goin' on.

01:23:03.283 --> 01:23:05.919
Maxine?

01:23:08.122 --> 01:23:11.258
That woman was in my bed
touching me!

01:23:44.426 --> 01:23:46.160
You're just
makin' things worse.

01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:47.595
Help me!

01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:49.531
Somebody! Please!

01:23:49.564 --> 01:23:51.466
Nobody is comin' for ya.

01:23:51.499 --> 01:23:54.402
Get back down in that cellar
and be quiet!

01:23:59.239 --> 01:24:01.975
- Shut up!
- Help!

01:24:02.009 --> 01:24:05.513
- Hey! Somebody, please!
- <i>Kidnappers, murderers,</i>

01:24:05.547 --> 01:24:07.147
<i>sex fiends,</i>

01:24:07.181 --> 01:24:08.248
<i>lurkin' where
we least expect...</i>

01:24:08.282 --> 01:24:09.316
Help!

01:24:09.349 --> 01:24:12.052
- Somebody, help!
- <i>...in good Christian homes,</i>

01:24:12.085 --> 01:24:14.388
<i>right under our very noses!</i>

01:24:21.195 --> 01:24:22.196
Jackson?

01:24:23.465 --> 01:24:24.466
Wayne?

01:24:25.365 --> 01:24:26.434
Where are y'all?

01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:45.587
Oh, my goodness.

01:24:46.286 --> 01:24:47.522
Ma'am?

01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:50.224
Ma'am? Be careful!

01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:53.093
Step away from the edge,
it's dangerous.

01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:57.665
It's all right. Here, here.

01:24:57.699 --> 01:25:00.468
You're safe now, okay?

01:25:00.502 --> 01:25:03.505
Are you hurt?
I don't see anything.

01:25:03.538 --> 01:25:05.807
My nana gets confused
sometimes as well.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.475
I learned all about it.

01:25:07.509 --> 01:25:08.576
Believe it or not,
I've even thought

01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:10.210
about becomin' a nurse
one day.

01:25:10.244 --> 01:25:11.278
So...

01:25:11.311 --> 01:25:12.547
Okay. Why don't you
come with...

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:14.114
Oh!

01:25:15.315 --> 01:25:16.551
What the hell
did you do that for?

01:25:16.584 --> 01:25:19.420
I don't need a nurse.

01:25:19.454 --> 01:25:21.321
Why should you get
to have it all?

01:25:21.355 --> 01:25:24.124
What have you ever done
except be a whore?

01:25:24.826 --> 01:25:28.195
Okay, you know what?

01:25:28.228 --> 01:25:30.598
You don't want my help?
No problem.

01:25:30.632 --> 01:25:32.634
I was just tryin' to be nice.

01:25:32.667 --> 01:25:35.335
You don't deserve
to be able to just flaunt it

01:25:35.369 --> 01:25:37.405
in my face like you do.

01:25:37.438 --> 01:25:40.608
It ain't my fault you didn't
live the life you wanted.

01:25:40.642 --> 01:25:43.811
Now move
out of the way, please.

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.416
Move! You mean old ugly b...

01:25:55.557 --> 01:25:56.691
Bitch.

01:26:21.482 --> 01:26:22.784
Was that the one?

01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:26.219
You know I don't like blondes.

01:26:43.504 --> 01:26:45.105
Disgustin'.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.348
Lorraine?

01:26:55.483 --> 01:26:56.484
RJ?

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:07.689
Uh, place is empty.

01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:11.391
What about
that other fella, Wayne?

01:28:11.426 --> 01:28:14.696
In the barn.
Stuck like the pig he was.

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:18.398
Well, that's three down.

01:28:18.433 --> 01:28:20.501
Four.

01:28:20.535 --> 01:28:23.638
And I got another
kept up at the house for you.

01:28:23.671 --> 01:28:25.272
I don't want her.

01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:27.542
This one was different.

01:28:27.575 --> 01:28:29.711
She had something special.

01:28:29.744 --> 01:28:31.344
Like I did.

01:28:31.378 --> 01:28:33.915
Sick and tired of never
gettin' what I want.

01:28:37.852 --> 01:28:40.488
You know I want to give it
to you, Pearl.

01:28:40.521 --> 01:28:42.523
But I'm tired, too.

01:28:45.626 --> 01:28:46.728
I know.

01:28:54.902 --> 01:28:56.871
Tell me I'm special.

01:29:02.777 --> 01:29:04.479
Of course you are.

01:29:07.648 --> 01:29:09.817
I've felt that way

01:29:09.851 --> 01:29:11.886
since the first moment we met.

01:29:13.688 --> 01:29:17.290
You were the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

01:29:22.329 --> 01:29:24.766
Oh, not anymore.

01:29:26.968 --> 01:29:28.503
Always.

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:37.310
Tell me I'm yours.

01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:41.949
That you still want me.

01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:53.326
Make me feel young again.

01:30:03.738 --> 01:30:05.606
What if my heart
can't take it?

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.908
It can.

01:31:43.104 --> 01:31:46.140
Fuck me, Howard.

01:31:46.173 --> 01:31:47.808
Fuck me.

01:32:04.926 --> 01:32:06.694
Fuck me.

01:32:26.047 --> 01:32:29.784
Help!

01:32:29.817 --> 01:32:30.985
Help!

01:32:31.018 --> 01:32:34.155
Somebody, help me, please!

01:33:14.195 --> 01:33:16.764
Let me out of here!

01:33:16.797 --> 01:33:18.132
Keep your voice down.

01:33:19.266 --> 01:33:20.835
Don't tell me
to be quiet!

01:33:20.868 --> 01:33:23.104
I was locked in a dungeon
down there!

01:33:23.137 --> 01:33:25.773
These old people
are fucking crazy!

01:33:25.806 --> 01:33:26.874
I have to get
out of this house

01:33:26.907 --> 01:33:28.242
before they kill me, too.

01:33:28.275 --> 01:33:30.311
We need to find the keys
to their truck.

01:33:30.344 --> 01:33:32.013
I never should have
listened to you.

01:33:32.046 --> 01:33:33.714
This is all your fault!

01:33:33.748 --> 01:33:35.883
Lorraine, we need
to stick together.

01:33:35.916 --> 01:33:37.651
I hate you!

01:33:37.685 --> 01:33:39.887
I hate you all so much!

01:33:40.788 --> 01:33:41.989
Lorraine!

01:33:46.594 --> 01:33:49.563
I told her to stay
in the damn cellar!

01:33:50.097 --> 01:33:51.599
That's all right.

01:33:52.266 --> 01:33:54.235
We don't need her anymore.

01:33:55.636 --> 01:33:58.239
We got each other again.

01:33:58.272 --> 01:34:00.841
Help me
drag the body inside.

01:34:00.875 --> 01:34:03.044
If she's in the house,
that's self-defense.

01:34:03.077 --> 01:34:05.012
That's the law.

01:34:05.046 --> 01:34:05.946
You don't
really believe

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.249
anyone's gonna come
looking for 'em, do you?

01:34:08.282 --> 01:34:09.950
We ain't
gonna risk it.

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.989
We need
to play this smart, Pearl.

01:34:15.022 --> 01:34:17.058
No sense in making a mess now.

01:34:18.893 --> 01:34:20.995
If nobody shows up
by tomorrow,

01:34:21.028 --> 01:34:23.164
we'll take the body
and we'll dump her

01:34:23.197 --> 01:34:25.032
in the pond with the others.

01:34:25.066 --> 01:34:27.234
Which reminds me,
we're gonna need

01:34:27.268 --> 01:34:29.003
to get Wayne outta the barn

01:34:29.036 --> 01:34:30.704
and sink him, too.

01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:50.024
She's heavier than she looks.

01:34:59.366 --> 01:35:01.268
Howard. Howard!

01:35:05.739 --> 01:35:06.774
Howard?

01:35:07.875 --> 01:35:08.909
Howard?

01:35:08.943 --> 01:35:10.077
Howard!

01:35:11.378 --> 01:35:13.280
Where are the keys
to the truck?

01:35:13.314 --> 01:35:15.716
- He's having a heart attack.
- I don't give a shit!

01:35:15.749 --> 01:35:17.852
- Where are the fucking keys?
- <i>Well, now...</i>

01:35:17.885 --> 01:35:19.687
- In the kitchen...
- <i>...here we all are...</i>

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.823
- ...under the lamp.
- <i>...together.</i>

01:35:22.857 --> 01:35:23.924
Howard?

01:35:23.958 --> 01:35:25.759
<i>We have reached a crossroad.</i>

01:35:25.793 --> 01:35:27.194
<i>With salvation...</i>

01:35:27.228 --> 01:35:28.929
- Howard?
- <i>...or damnation?</i>

01:35:28.963 --> 01:35:31.899
You're gonna rot when people
find out what you've done.

01:35:31.932 --> 01:35:33.067
<i>The time is now.</i>

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:36.036
- What I have done?
- <i>For if we do not take control</i>

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:38.239
- <i>of our own fate, the Lord...</i>
- What about you?

01:35:38.272 --> 01:35:40.040
<i>...shall do it for us.</i>

01:35:40.074 --> 01:35:42.376
You don't think I know
who you really are?

01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:45.713
I saw what you did
in the barn.

01:35:45.746 --> 01:35:47.915
You're a deviant little whore.

01:35:48.816 --> 01:35:49.884
We're the same.

01:35:52.219 --> 01:35:54.422
You'll end up just like me.

01:35:54.456 --> 01:35:57.758
<i>Time to turn our backs on sin
and make the commitment...</i>

01:35:57.791 --> 01:35:58.926
I'm nothin' like you.

01:35:58.959 --> 01:36:00.194
<i>...once and for all.</i>

01:36:00.227 --> 01:36:02.763
You're a kidnappin',
murderin' sex fiend.

01:36:02.796 --> 01:36:04.298
I'm a fucking star!

01:36:04.331 --> 01:36:05.332
The whole world
is gonna know my name.

01:36:05.366 --> 01:36:06.700
<i>I want
to hear you all.</i>

01:36:06.734 --> 01:36:08.135
<i>Say it with me now.</i>

01:36:08.169 --> 01:36:09.870
I will not accept a life

01:36:09.904 --> 01:36:11.772
- I do not deserve.
- <i>I will not accept a life</i>

01:36:11.805 --> 01:36:14.308
<i>I do not deserve.</i>

01:36:14.341 --> 01:36:16.944
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

01:36:16.977 --> 01:36:19.380
Stop fuckin' starin' at me!

01:36:48.042 --> 01:36:52.379
<i>Now, that's what I call
divine intervention!</i>

01:36:52.414 --> 01:36:58.852
<i>The Lord smiles on those who
accept Him. Praise his name!</i>

01:36:58.886 --> 01:37:02.356
<i>Glory be to Jesus!</i>

01:37:21.008 --> 01:37:24.211
My hip...

01:37:24.245 --> 01:37:25.246
Help.

01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:33.087
Shh!

01:37:44.532 --> 01:37:46.333
You whore!

01:37:47.535 --> 01:37:49.537
You're not innocent!

01:37:51.573 --> 01:37:53.508
You're not special!

01:37:54.942 --> 01:37:58.112
It'll all be taken from you!

01:37:58.145 --> 01:38:00.781
Just like it was from me!

01:38:01.549 --> 01:38:02.584
I'll tell everyone

01:38:02.617 --> 01:38:04.251
what you are!

01:38:10.124 --> 01:38:11.526
It'll be our secret.

01:38:30.578 --> 01:38:32.514
Divine intervention.

01:38:58.339 --> 01:39:00.442
Praise the fuckin' Lord.

01:39:19.326 --> 01:39:22.896
<i>I hope that,
through my own admission,</i>

01:39:22.930 --> 01:39:24.599
<i>others may find the light.</i>

01:39:25.633 --> 01:39:27.334
<i>I wanna show y'all somethin'.</i>

01:39:29.571 --> 01:39:31.038
<i>Get a shot of this.</i>

01:39:33.974 --> 01:39:35.376
<i>There she is.</i>

01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:37.579
<i>My beautiful
little daughter Maxine.</i>

01:39:38.379 --> 01:39:40.482
<i>Lured into a life of sin</i>

01:39:40.515 --> 01:39:41.915
<i>by the very deviants</i>

01:39:41.949 --> 01:39:45.252
<i>we warn of here
on a daily basis.</i>

01:39:45.285 --> 01:39:49.524
<i>From our lovin' home
into the hands of devils.</i>

01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:52.527
<i>We pray, one day,</i>

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.230
<i>she'll find her way home
to us.</i>

01:39:56.263 --> 01:39:58.232
<i>Amen.</i>

01:39:58.265 --> 01:40:00.402
<i>Bless you, bless you.</i>

01:40:09.977 --> 01:40:11.579
What do you reckon
happened, Sheriff?

01:40:14.682 --> 01:40:16.484
How the hell
should I know?

01:40:21.054 --> 01:40:22.256
Hey, boss.

01:40:26.193 --> 01:40:29.664
One of the boys
found this inside.

01:40:33.668 --> 01:40:35.202
What do you think is on it?

01:40:37.371 --> 01:40:40.575
Well, by the looks
of everythin'...

01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:45.680
I'd say one goddamn fucked up
horror picture.

01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:56.590
