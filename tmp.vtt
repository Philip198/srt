00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.733
Where did it go wrong? You have
a serious masturbation problem.

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.718
It's better than taking
my sexual frustrations out

00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:17.487
on a parade of one-night skanks
I'll never see again.

00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:18.688
- True.
- Good morning.

00:14:18.689 --> 00:14:20.324
Hey, no, no, come here.
This is dusty.

00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:21.992
Dusty's my roommate-slash-cousin.

00:14:21.993 --> 00:14:23.877
But not technically blood-related.

00:14:23.878 --> 00:14:26.113
Our parents were friends
until his mom walked out.

00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:28.582
Slash-fuckhead for bringing up
bad family shit

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.017
at inappropriate times.

00:14:30.018 --> 00:14:30.884
It's nice to meet you.

00:14:30.885 --> 00:14:32.052
Nice to meet you.

00:14:32.053 --> 00:14:33.304
Fucking family.

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:34.154
What's the plan tonight?

00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:35.439
Bring this girl back here,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.408
pop open chloroform,
insert tab A into slot B?

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:41.244
No. Tonight is the night
I tell her how I feel.

00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:43.714
Tank, this girl--
this girl is my soul mate,

00:14:43.715 --> 00:14:44.949
and it's time she knew that.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.451
Not if you want to fuck her.

00:14:47.452 --> 00:14:48.719
You, what is the nicest thing

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.621
I've said to you since I met you?

00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:53.223
You complimented me on my technique.

00:14:53.224 --> 00:14:54.825
All right, look,
I'm not you, okay?

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:58.161
I'm not gonna manipulate her,
I'm not gonna con her.

00:14:58.162 --> 00:15:00.030
- I'm just gonna be myself.
- Nope.

00:15:00.031 --> 00:15:01.799
Yourself is a repressed head case

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.567
that beats more meat
than Rocky Balboa.

00:15:03.568 --> 00:15:05.869
So by hiding your porn,
taking her to joints you hate,

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.337
training for a fucking marathon,

00:15:07.338 --> 00:15:08.973
you're not showing her
the real you.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.941
You're showing her a
highlight reel you.

00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:12.843
Thus, in fact, you're conning her.

00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:14.344
- You don't get it.
- Mm.

00:15:14.345 --> 00:15:15.345
You don't get it.

00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:18.315
I love her. Alexis--

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:19.950
Alexis is my angel.

<i>(Man whistles, horn honks)</i>

- <i>(Chuckles)

We don't get it.
We don't.

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:30.828
Uh-- anyway, we can skip
this "call me" scenario.

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:32.162
I'm already late.
Great.

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:33.914
I wanna know something.
This chick, uh--

00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:35.332
- What's her name?
- Alexis.

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:37.568
If this chick Alexis
means so much to you,

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:38.935
how come I haven't met her yet?

00:15:38.936 --> 00:15:41.038
'Cause she means that much to me.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:44.007
Mazel Tov, man.
Love. Angels.

00:15:44.008 --> 00:15:45.376
Awesome.

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:47.044
What about that girl at camp

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:49.313
who used to let, uh,
you play with her boobies?

00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:51.215
Jackie? We were 15.

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:53.083
Yeah. She looked like
a baton with titties.

00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:54.951
What about Gracie,
love of your life,

00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:56.554
till you caught her
blowing Holstein

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.155
at the dance marathon
freshman year?

00:15:58.156 --> 00:15:59.323
What's your point?

00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:01.058
My point is this,
Lindsay, gym crush.

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:04.161
Melissa, your barista.
Lot of angels, Dust.

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:05.596
Why you gotta be such an asshole?

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:06.797
It's what I do, man.

00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:08.699
Listen, good luck tonight.
If you need 'em,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.334

This is absurd.

What? You love steak,
we're eating steak.

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:31.772
You're a vegan.

00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:35.025
Not tonight.
Eat, eat, eat. Eat. Enjoy.

00:16:35.026 --> 00:16:37.178
I feel a little guilty

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.613

Being exclusive would be a step.

Or moving in together is a step.
