00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.673
Goddess Bast, time is running out.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.183
Help me heal my brother.

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:13.374
And I won't doubt it
your existence again.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:16.664
- His pulse dropped.
- The sequence is almost over.

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:21.666
- Grio, give me control.
- As you wish, Princess.

00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:29.653
- What is the success rate?
- At 25%.

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:31.654
I have to try something else.

00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:35.646
King Chala's heartbeat
decreased to 31 beats per minute.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.654
- Princess, you must go next to him.
- I have to think. Get out.

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:43.678
Get out!

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:51.658
- What is the success rate?
- At 29.1%.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.671
Print it!

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.653
I know it's urgent, but I have to
to warn you

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:05.663
This synthetic heart is nothing like it
to have the desired effect.

00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:09.681
I do not care!
It should work.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.648
- Gray...
- Yes, princess?

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:33.674
What is my brother's heart rate?

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:42.681
Your brother is with the ancestors.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.676
No...

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:59.652
Thanks for the gift.

00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:03.648
By King Anda Raja T'Challa.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:07.139
Of the Black Panther.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.807
His son Putra Raja T'Chaka.

00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:14.266
My son.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:20.075
Descendants of the great King Basenga,

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:22.925
Of the first Black Panther.

00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:27.671
He left us and went away.
We honor the ancestors.

00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:51.323
I'll miss you...

UN, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:36.656
It is an honor for me to invite
Your Majesty Queen Ramon,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.666
Princess Lumumba,
and the Queen of Wakanda.

00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:56.649
Sir, Secretary.

00:06:56.673 --> 00:07:01.665
I want to speak for everyone
of the Member States when I say,

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.185
that I am deeply disappointed
since the failure of Wakanda

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:08.205
to live up to their promises,

00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:12.657
to become a global player,
to overcome international challenges,

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:18.647
to share resources and collaborate
fully for vibranium.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:21.647
France has said,

00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:23.413
that vibranium
can be used

00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:26.063
for weapons production
mass destruction.

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:30.657
The substance does not activate
the metal detectors.

00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:35.665
This is a safety hazard
and the non-proliferation treaty.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:39.673
I give the floor to Queen Ramon.

00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:51.653
Our policy has always been not to
we ever deal with vibranium

00:07:51.677 --> 00:07:54.654
under any circumstances.

00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:59.655
Not because of potential
dangers of vibranium,

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.673
but at your own risk.

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:09.682 line:50%
FOUR FAMILIES
WAKANDA ANSOGOU, MALI

00:08:16.673 --> 00:08:18.325
The image on the monitor went black.

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:26.111
Calm down!
Fall to the floor!

00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:29.378
Where is the vibranium?

00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:35.681
Who has access to it?

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:49.657
Pretend to be polite.

00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:54.650
But we know why you're talking
inside government buildings

00:08:54.674 --> 00:08:57.688
and in military installations.

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:04.668
"The king is dead."

00:09:05.688 --> 00:09:08.686
Black Panther is gone.

00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:14.666
They lost their patron.

00:09:19.687 --> 00:09:23.681
Now we have the opportunity to...

00:09:24.682 --> 00:09:25.685
"...we attack."

00:09:52.684 --> 00:09:57.670
- Varius, where is your spear?
- Suri gave me these.

00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:01.646
I prefer them.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.678
Our ancestors gave us the spears.

00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:09.676
... on and off.

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:14.475
Nothing changes under my watch.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.193
Yes, General.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:20.682
I said don't take them.

00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:27.491
Last night an installation of ours
was attacked.

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:31.660
I can prove that the UN
is behind it

00:10:31.684 --> 00:10:36.573
as it downloads to your phone.

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:40.546
And as for the identity of the culprit...

00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:53.689
Kneel down!

00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:59.619
Here is.

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:06.676
Consider the answer to this
the attack as a friendly gesture.

00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:13.664
Further attempts to steal our resources
will be considered an attack

00:11:13.688 --> 00:11:19.651
and will cause
a stronger reaction from us.

00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:25.650
We mourn our king.
But don't believe at all,

00:11:25.674 --> 00:11:31.119
that Wakanda has lost the ability
to protect its resources.

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:35.324
We know your efforts
which are under development

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:37.734
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda.

00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:43.058
And I wish you good luck.

00:11:46.683 --> 00:11:50.671
Atlantic ocean
Rotor 625 requested clearance to land.

00:11:54.677 --> 00:11:56.684
See you inside.

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:04.195
- Didn't you retire?
- I thought so too.

00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:07.897
The odds of finding vibranium
they should be very few.

00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:09.039
I think so too.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.689
Cabin pressure good.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:42.647
240 meters.

00:12:43.256 --> 00:12:46.710
- Move to the next layer.
- All systems OK.

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:49.670
Received.

00:12:58.675 --> 00:13:00.253
We have reached the bottom.

00:13:07.676 --> 00:13:11.526
Great then, Salazar, you're close.

00:13:12.678 --> 00:13:15.008
This is awesome.

00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:19.928
The drill seems to have
hit something like metal.

00:13:20.777 --> 00:13:22.356
At least it's stable.

00:13:23.213 --> 00:13:25.624
I've never seen a drill before
to be so shattered.

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:32.373
Amen, man.
Vibran in the ocean.

00:13:32.573 --> 00:13:36.293
Let's get rid of the tracker.
It's all we have.

00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:39.624
We are heading
in the vibranium detector.

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:54.804
- Everything went dark.
- Power supply stopped.

00:13:55.303 --> 00:13:56.756
I'll take care of it from now on.

00:14:12.672 --> 00:14:14.679
What the hell was that?

00:14:27.669 --> 00:14:30.759
Jackson, did you see that too?

00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:33.104
Salazar's beats.

00:14:33.344 --> 00:14:35.290
Salazar, can you take a picture?

00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:40.945
A jellyfish.
I have never seen such a color before.

00:14:41.992 --> 00:14:43.715
Rescue Squad, alert.

00:14:43.853 --> 00:14:47.345
Salazar, Jackson's Vital Organs
they do not work. You see him;

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.243
- No, he left.
- What do you mean, he left?

00:15:00.685 --> 00:15:04.667
Salazar, can you hear me?
Salazar?

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:06.686
NO SIGNAL

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:11.060
Smith, something is wrong.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.999
- What sound is that?
- Where is that sound coming from?

00:15:33.017 --> 00:15:34.789
From the west, finally?

00:15:36.688 --> 00:15:38.582
West, do you see anything?

00:15:58.096 --> 00:16:01.459
- It's a sonic attack.
- Wear earplugs.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.326
We are under attack.
Send in a strike team.

00:16:11.724 --> 00:16:15.094
Help, help. 625 rotors here.

00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:16.565
Send help immediately.

00:16:16.688 --> 00:16:17.610
He's from Wakanda.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.951
Of course.

00:16:36.672 --> 00:16:37.817
Henderson!

00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:39.169
We have to get out of here.

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:40.369
Henderson!

00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:42.681
Come!

00:16:44.687 --> 00:16:47.681
- What happens;
- Get down from there.

00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:05.675
Chase her!

00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:27.682
Throw, Throw, Throw!

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:37.681
Fly, get rid of them!

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.089
- They leave.
- Oh my god...

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:04.687
- Take us away.
- We are OK.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:07.259
Where's the strike team?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.599
The code is blue.
Everyone is dead.

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:15.517
- What happened;
- They're pulling us back!

00:18:23.677 --> 00:18:25.676
Wait!

00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:04.733
The Queen of Wakanda gave yesterday
a strong speech at the United Nations,

00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:09.456
while the captured mercenaries
were brought before the Assembly.

00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:13.406
The Queen is restored
as regent of Wakanda,

00:19:13.612 --> 00:19:16.937
when King Chala died
last year from an unknown illness.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.651
This small nation is preparing for battle
and is increasingly isolated.

00:19:22.377 --> 00:19:26.133
Highness...
We are approaching the border.

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:34.260
We returned home.

00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:27.907
- Princess...
- Wait a minute, I'm doing something.

00:20:28.254 --> 00:20:31.369
- I know, but...
- You're interrupting my thoughts.

00:20:34.265 --> 00:20:37.077
- Suri.
- Mother.

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:40.459
I wanted to tell you that the queen has arrived.

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:41.391
Thanks.

00:20:41.469 --> 00:20:46.684
You make me nervous. One day the artificial
intelligence will kill us all.

00:20:46.884 --> 00:20:49.075
Artificial intelligence
it's not like in the movies.

00:20:49.442 --> 00:20:51.548
It's exactly what I tell him to do.

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:54.563
I wish all kids were like that.

00:20:55.285 --> 00:20:57.923
Everyone seems to be working hard.

00:20:58.212 --> 00:21:01.921
This is the emergency team.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:07.123
There can be many threats
out there and we find the solutions.

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:12.004
- What is this;
- Uniforms for soldiers.

00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:16.890
It provides the user with increased
strength, speed and endurance.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.236
But like everything they don't like it.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.382
- Which one;
- He hates them.

00:21:27.264 --> 00:21:30.169
What about creating a heart?

00:21:30.369 --> 00:21:32.384
Have you ever thought
that he would not approve?

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:35.321
sorry princess
Nakia, Princess of Yaa,

00:21:35.388 --> 00:21:36.758
is trying to find you again.

00:21:37.352 --> 00:21:39.650
- Maybe I should...
- Be careful with the calculations

00:21:39.893 --> 00:21:41.147
and don't distract me.

00:21:41.347 --> 00:21:42.584
As you wish princess.

00:21:43.273 --> 00:21:48.708
We don't need the filter.
We need new technology.

00:21:48.878 --> 00:21:50.212
What will happen to black panther?

00:21:53.254 --> 00:21:57.073
This title has stuck with the nation for centuries.

00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:59.205
Black Panther is a thing of the past.

00:21:59.428 --> 00:22:01.462
I wasn't trying to save the title.

00:22:01.604 --> 00:22:03.597
I was trying to save my brother.

00:22:05.264 --> 00:22:07.217
Shuri...

00:22:20.273 --> 00:22:24.273
- What day is today;
- Tuesday.

00:22:25.253 --> 00:22:27.270
Date, son.

00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:36.424
- My brother died.
- It was a year ago.

00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:51.245
- Have you planned anything?
- Yes. We must be together.

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:53.248
- Now?
- Yes.

00:22:54.074 --> 00:22:56.106
Just leave the chemotherapy pearls.

00:22:56.265 --> 00:22:58.736
You won't need them where we're going.

00:23:03.712 --> 00:23:04.889
Also the other two.

00:23:30.254 --> 00:23:33.936
Sit here with me and alone.

00:23:34.643 --> 00:23:36.820
It's the only way for them to heal

00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:39.283
the wounds after T'Challa's death.

00:23:39.483 --> 00:23:40.578
I'm fine, mother.

00:23:42.264 --> 00:23:43.934
Do not worry about me.

00:23:45.252 --> 00:23:48.916
He left, but I moved on.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:53.611
Chala is dead,
but it doesn't mean it's gone.

00:23:54.703 --> 00:23:56.273
When the disease killed
your brother

00:23:57.253 --> 00:24:01.373
I had to lead a nation
wounded in a world in crisis.

00:24:02.002 --> 00:24:04.347
But I still went to the bushes.

00:24:05.389 --> 00:24:07.960
I wandered until I found water,

00:24:08.252 --> 00:24:10.272
and then I sat down.

00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:15.635
So I did the ritual
which I will show you now.

00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:23.235
I found your brother in the breeze.

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:27.244
He pushed me gently but firmly,

00:24:27.268 --> 00:24:31.248
whose hand was on my shoulder.

00:24:31.272 --> 00:24:34.273
It's been a while,

00:24:35.253 --> 00:24:38.257
but it was there.

00:24:43.257 --> 00:24:46.238
He wasn't there, mother.

00:24:46.262 --> 00:24:50.291
The presence you felt
it is an illusion of the mind

00:24:52.681 --> 00:24:55.421
to entertain you
or to please you.

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:57.273
Only that.

00:25:04.272 --> 00:25:10.247
What feeling do you feel?
when you think of your brother?

00:25:10.271 --> 00:25:13.273
It brings you comfort...

00:25:14.253 --> 00:25:15.273
...or sadness?

00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:31.262
Come on, my child.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.231
- Where did you find this;
- Does not matter;

00:25:45.255 --> 00:25:48.230
What do they have to do with ritual?

00:25:48.254 --> 00:25:53.291
We burn the funeral clothes to
end the mourning period

00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:58.973
and start new relationships
leaving our loved ones.

00:25:59.173 --> 00:26:00.626
I don't know, mom.

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:07.234
If I sit I will think
my brother for a long time...

00:26:07.258 --> 00:26:09.966
... not the clothes I burned.

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:15.269
The whole world does that.

00:26:17.252 --> 00:26:18.268
Shuri...

00:26:22.923 --> 00:26:27.610
Suri, there's something you have to do
to tell you about your brother.

00:26:31.272 --> 00:26:34.270
Mother, wait.
What are you doing;

00:27:00.255 --> 00:27:03.478
- Is it part of the ceremony?
- No it is not.

00:27:05.254 --> 00:27:06.944
Keep still!

00:27:07.567 --> 00:27:10.550
Who are you and how did you get in here?

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.619
This place is perfect.

00:27:14.707 --> 00:27:16.342
The air is still pristine.

00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:19.014
And the water...

00:27:20.256 --> 00:27:22.748
My mom told me about it.

00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:25.657
protected country,
where people never leave

00:27:25.857 --> 00:27:29.391
or change their lifestyle.

00:27:30.452 --> 00:27:33.088
What reason did you have to reveal?
this secret in the world?

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.945
I don't like repeating myself.

00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:38.625
Who you are;

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.942
I have many names.

00:27:40.177 --> 00:27:43.510
My folks call me Kukulan.

00:27:46.253 --> 00:27:48.128
My enemies call me Namor.

00:27:49.265 --> 00:27:54.364
The US military found vibranium
under my own Royal rule.

00:27:54.688 --> 00:27:58.685
I could stop the export,

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.082
but we needed
the help of wakanda,

00:28:01.282 --> 00:28:02.654
so that it doesn't happen again.

00:28:04.078 --> 00:28:06.641
They have a machine developed
by a scientist.

00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:10.471
Vibranium is only found here.

00:28:10.671 --> 00:28:12.839
Mom, he's covered in it.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.970
Your son revealed
the power of vibranium, in the world.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.647
It had caused other countries to terminate
this planet after that.

00:28:24.847 --> 00:28:28.058
His choice put us in danger.

00:28:28.358 --> 00:28:32.365
I think you can find some
researchers and bring them to me.

00:28:33.504 --> 00:28:37.378
It's only natural that Wakanda should help
in solving our dilemma.

00:28:37.471 --> 00:28:42.485
You are sneaking into my country
and you tell me what is fair.

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:47.255
My army is so
as numerous as blades of grass

00:28:48.524 --> 00:28:51.196
and their power is incomparable.

00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:54.298
I would not return under any other circumstances.

00:29:00.254 --> 00:29:03.254
When you find the researchers, burn them.

00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:06.992
Then I'll be there in no time.

00:29:10.645 --> 00:29:11.618
For your own sake,

00:29:12.076 --> 00:29:15.919
please don't say my name
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

00:29:24.258 --> 00:29:27.266
Did you see the feathers on his ankles?

00:29:41.266 --> 00:29:44.228
How did he do it?

00:29:44.428 --> 00:29:46.766
We must convene the Council.

00:29:48.252 --> 00:29:51.934
Heaven Scrapers has not
recorded activity.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.752
Was the river border breached?

00:29:59.188 --> 00:30:00.860
I wish my soldiers were there,

00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:05.129
this fisherman would already be in front of you.

00:30:05.282 --> 00:30:10.732
If your army was there,
they would still lie there dazed.

00:30:10.873 --> 00:30:14.012
- You are a bald devil.
- Show each other respect.

00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:14.920
Respect?

00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:18.923
- These people should be ashamed.
- Watch how you speak, Jabari.

00:30:32.442 --> 00:30:36.964
As I said, he didn't show up
on some surveillance camera.

00:30:37.104 --> 00:30:42.102
- Not even on the radar.
- Did he swim 100 kilometers?

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:45.914
And he claims to lead a large army.

00:30:46.114 --> 00:30:51.437
He wants us to catch an investigator
American to kill him?

00:30:51.637 --> 00:30:52.610
Do it.

00:30:54.263 --> 00:30:58.402
We never had an enemy that had vibranium

00:30:59.617 --> 00:31:01.737
and we don't have Black Panther
to protect us.

00:31:01.877 --> 00:31:05.254
Why did you let Kilman take the throne?

00:31:06.006 --> 00:31:08.070
and burn all heart-shaped potions.

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:13.271
- Baku, what do you want us to do?
- Find the fisherman and kill him.

00:31:14.251 --> 00:31:17.141
If we do what he asks now,

00:31:17.341 --> 00:31:21.943
what will prevent him from coming
and demand more?

00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:33.249
Sit down.

00:31:33.273 --> 00:31:39.971
- Is it my idea or is it ugly?
- It's your idea.

00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:41.976
It works;

00:31:42.176 --> 00:31:46.423
Yes, the machine can
to detect vibranium

00:31:46.542 --> 00:31:49.628
through water, rocks
and heavy metals.

00:31:49.828 --> 00:31:51.594
Whoever did this
he is an excellent inventor.

00:31:51.986 --> 00:31:52.918
Come and see.

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:56.606
Some pieces are manufactured
By order,

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.530
while others look like something out of a mantra.

00:31:58.824 --> 00:32:03.708
I still find it hard to believe
that there is vibranium outside of Wukanda.

00:32:03.866 --> 00:32:06.051
There may have been two meteorites.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:08.317
The planet is covered mostly by water,

00:32:08.369 --> 00:32:11.662
so of course the others
to end up there.

00:32:11.837 --> 00:32:16.544
- This changes everything we know.
- The mountains, all the myths...

00:32:17.271 --> 00:32:21.944
- They are etched in my mind.
- That sounds painful.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.677
Then we have to find
this researcher.

00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:29.132
I have an idea.

00:32:30.517 --> 00:32:33.547
- I'll need the princess.
- Don't subject her to this.

00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:37.249
- She's not ready at all.
- Your Highness...

00:32:38.649 --> 00:32:41.044
It would do her good to get out a little.

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:44.552
Maybe he needs it.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:48.899
And I can handle
blindfolded Americans.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.536
They are not the ones that worry me.

00:32:52.252 --> 00:32:56.260
He got past our defenses.

00:32:56.412 --> 00:33:00.068
- It will not happen again.
- He's not alone.

00:33:00.268 --> 00:33:02.270
He wants to be with me.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:08.316
When are we going to visit?
my favorite colonist?

00:33:11.258 --> 00:33:13.870 line:50%
ALEXANDRIA
VIRGINIA

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.304
Come on...

00:33:40.256 --> 00:33:43.684
Yes, I'm in.
I follow.

00:33:46.254 --> 00:33:47.372
Slower.

00:33:54.251 --> 00:33:57.639
- You couldn't call?
- I didn't know your number?

00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:01.528
We are looking for the scientist

00:34:01.728 --> 00:34:03.515
who discovered the vibranium detector.

00:34:03.715 --> 00:34:05.230
Then you were in the Atlantic.

00:34:07.013 --> 00:34:08.841
Ship drilling, many dead...

00:34:10.338 --> 00:34:11.835
- What happened;
- Seriously?

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:16.823
It was us and the frogmen.

00:34:17.023 --> 00:34:19.821
30 of the best
and two officers.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:23.552
My personal friend, he died in one hit.

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:29.108
- They were looking for vibranium...
- Wakanda is not behind this.

00:34:29.308 --> 00:34:30.900
Then who was it?

00:34:33.016 --> 00:34:34.839
For this to work...

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.098
When I give you information,
you have to give me something too.

00:34:37.244 --> 00:34:39.191
We can't tell you that.

00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:43.526
We need to communicate
with the investigators before it is too late.

00:34:43.726 --> 00:34:47.241
You owe me this, Ross.
You owe it to my brother.

00:34:51.258 --> 00:34:52.273
Okay, listen.

00:34:53.253 --> 00:34:57.433
An agent was sentenced to death
with less than I will tell you now.

00:34:58.032 --> 00:35:01.281
And our new boss is like a hawk.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.073
We have to be very careful.

00:35:04.273 --> 00:35:06.646
You also need to be careful
and be quick.

00:35:06.887 --> 00:35:08.236
USA needs new engines,

00:35:08.429 --> 00:35:10.792
and the girl is the only one
to the world that can make it.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.068
- And they will chase it.
- Girl?

00:35:15.872 --> 00:35:20.018
CAMBRIDGE
MASSACHUSETTS

00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:26.930
- You forgot to transfer money.
- Yes.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.960
- It's 800, right?
- That was yesterday.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.183
- Now it's interest.
- This is robbery.

00:35:34.747 --> 00:35:38.529
I made my own robot arm.
I just fixed the algorithm.

00:35:39.255 --> 00:35:41.269
And how much will it cost?

00:35:46.267 --> 00:35:47.268
Thanks

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.242
- Is this an iPhone?
- Primitive.

00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:58.566
Your Highness, we found the investigator...
343
00:35:59,130 ​​--&gt; 00:36:02,492
partner for Wakanda schools.

00:36:03.824 --> 00:36:06.396
I hope he is a professor.

00:36:06.596 --> 00:36:08.193
She is a student, a mother.

00:36:08.554 --> 00:36:10.185
We can't give her to Namor.

00:36:10.385 --> 00:36:13.607
Bring her to Wakanda.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.778
Yes, Your Highness.

00:36:18.272 --> 00:36:22.622
- I'm in charge now.
- Let me talk to her.

00:36:22.992 --> 00:36:26.640
- It would be more subtle.
- I can be discreet.

00:36:30.251 --> 00:36:32.135
- What is;
- Nothing.

00:36:32.324 --> 00:36:33.317
- Is this makeup?
- Nice.

00:36:34.368 --> 00:36:39.235
- Is the shadow wrong?
- No, Fendi. You look fine.

00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:43.272
I can look like a student.
I can do it.

00:36:47.255 --> 00:36:48.492
You have five minutes.

00:37:01.256 --> 00:37:03.423
- Yes?
- Riri Williams?

00:37:06.267 --> 00:37:08.632
I don't accept visitors.

00:37:08.676 --> 00:37:10.160
You must visit
my website.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.598
This is an encrypted file.
I'll leave it here.

00:37:15.258 --> 00:37:17.258
Are you...

00:37:19.252 --> 00:37:21.043
You are Princess Suri.

00:37:22.256 --> 00:37:26.250
What are you doing here;
Will you recruit me?

00:37:27.262 --> 00:37:33.246
No. I came for the scout
of the vibranium you made for the Co.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.246
I didn't make it for the CIA,
but as a metallurgical mission.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:43.242
- Homework;
- The teacher said it was impossible.

00:37:43.266 --> 00:37:48.246
But we are young
talented and black.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.263
Maybe we don't say that in Wakanda.

00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:56.243
- How old are you;
- 19.

00:37:56.267 --> 00:38:00.910
A genius is not recognized
always by the elders.

00:38:02.258 --> 00:38:05.330
- How much will it take?
- Several months.

00:38:05.651 --> 00:38:06.530
Several months?

00:38:06.697 --> 00:38:09.428
The hardest part was
to find enough leaves.

00:38:10.258 --> 00:38:12.334
Is Wakanda mad at me?

00:38:12.602 --> 00:38:15.944
Not just us.
You're in danger here.

00:38:16.665 --> 00:38:18.985
Pack your things and come with me.

00:38:19.268 --> 00:38:23.136
I have calculus in a quarter of an hour...

00:38:25.253 --> 00:38:26.245
Okay.

00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:31.132
Okay, wait here.

00:38:31.332 --> 00:38:33.138
I want to go to the bathroom.

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:42.837
- I had it under control.
- I said five minutes. Six passed.

00:38:43.108 --> 00:38:46.259
Get out of my room.
Get out!

00:38:48.708 --> 00:38:51.689
Don't come one step closer!

00:38:52.104 --> 00:38:54.613
You see how they teach children
to deal with the guests?

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.233
- Do you have a spear with you?
- You brought a spear.

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:07.270
- I like.
- Put it down.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.245
- You're going to get hurt.
- Leave me, my daughter.

00:39:11.269 --> 00:39:17.233
Girl, I'm giving you two choices.

00:39:17.257 --> 00:39:21.678
You can come to Wakanda
alive or unconscious.

00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:28.180
You should take more care
your appearance, than your face.

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:32.100
- Do you find it funny?
- No it is not.

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.157
- I told you.
- You were fine.

00:39:34.357 --> 00:39:35.466
Let's go.

00:39:35.556 --> 00:39:38.878
Let's tell him to come
to fight alongside the mermaid

00:39:39.381 --> 00:39:43.771
with ankle feathers,
who wants to kill him, alone.

00:39:43.997 --> 00:39:45.394
You can do it easily.

00:39:45.558 --> 00:39:46.796
You and your heater.

00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:49.253
Here you go;

00:39:55.479 --> 00:39:58.445
Where are we;

00:39:58.469 --> 00:40:01.479
I built some cars for the boss.

00:40:02.815 --> 00:40:07.459
And it allows me to work.
I have to get my laptop.

00:40:10.468 --> 00:40:15.283
- Please don't touch anything.
- Do not worry.

00:40:15.583 --> 00:40:19.504
It may not seem,
but it is my life's work.

00:40:19.704 --> 00:40:23.765
Well, the image on the screen
do you have it on your laptop too?

00:40:24.466 --> 00:40:27.256
And you've left it at that
open in the workshop?

00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:30.591
It is encrypted at 2065-bytes.

00:40:31.072 --> 00:40:32.058
Impressive.

00:40:32.258 --> 00:40:36.139
- Have you ever been locked out?
- Yes, a whole semester.

00:40:36.855 --> 00:40:40.558
I had to build a quantum computer
to crack my own encryption.

00:40:40.758 --> 00:40:42.027
What technology is this?

00:40:42.514 --> 00:40:44.708
- Is it Stark technology?
- I said don't touch anything.

00:40:44.974 --> 00:40:47.811
Princess, the police just arrived.

00:40:48.461 --> 00:40:50.872
- Who is this;
- My artificial intelligence.

00:40:51.477 --> 00:40:53.468
They surround us.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.716
You said a mermaid is chasing me.
These are Federalists.

00:41:14.475 --> 00:41:19.480
I don't need this.
I swear.

00:41:19.814 --> 00:41:22.620
This is not going to go very well.
I was very dumb.

00:41:22.925 --> 00:41:28.841
The Princess of Wakanda has arrived
at my door, then all was lost.

00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:32.755
I'm thinking of risking it, with the mermaid.

00:41:32.955 --> 00:41:36.292
At least he hasn't
nothing to do with the FBI.

00:41:38.336 --> 00:41:43.648
Namor sank a boat
of SIA because of your machine.

00:41:43.848 --> 00:41:47.691
So for them it is the least
that you should worry about.

00:41:47.891 --> 00:41:52.896
We have to work together to get out.
General, we are surrounded.

00:41:53.096 --> 00:41:55.480
- Maybe we should split up.
- This is not possible.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.448
- Do the vehicles work?
- No.

00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:03.481
Everything works,
like these machines.

00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:08.673
Forget it.
After all, there are three of us.

00:42:08.873 --> 00:42:11.739
There are two of you.
I'll take this.

00:42:12.468 --> 00:42:16.450
I knew the. Don't tell me
that you made it in two months?

00:42:16.474 --> 00:42:19.454
It took me ages with this one.

00:42:19.478 --> 00:42:24.151
- Have you ever thrown it away?
- It can fly;

00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:27.957
There are many channels on YouTube
that guide you how to fly.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.032
It's fantastic.

00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:33.328
We have an arrest warrant
for Riri Williams!

00:42:33.389 --> 00:42:36.288
We have a wireless device
so we will communicate.

00:42:36.446 --> 00:42:40.626
General Okoi and Princess Shuri,
go out with your hands up.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.634
- What scrap metal.
- Be careful with these.

00:42:45.463 --> 00:42:46.921
The key is on the chair.

00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:50.230
When we cross the bridge,
they won't be able to catch us.

00:42:50.406 --> 00:42:51.912
We have to separate.

00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:55.769
The laboratory is not our home.

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:59.472
- Then get in the car.
- He always has to shout.

00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:08.505
We will break the door in three,

00:43:08.705 --> 00:43:11.300
two one.

00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:14.475
FBI!
Don't move.

00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:19.460
- What was that;
- He has an Iron Man suit!

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.136
Stay still!

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.635
- So it flies.
- Gray...

00:43:26.845 --> 00:43:28.191
- Yes, Princess.
- ...now!

00:43:28.391 --> 00:43:29.834
Remote control activated.

00:43:30.053 --> 00:43:30.650
Let's go!

00:43:43.464 --> 00:43:46.373
Grio, turn on the video.

00:43:54.464 --> 00:43:56.044
- Gray...
- Yes, General.

00:43:56.244 --> 00:43:57.997
Take me to the princess.

00:43:58.414 --> 00:44:01.233
Otherwise, I will nail
my spear to your editor

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:04.439
and you won't be able to edit
data for the next century.

00:44:04.604 --> 00:44:05.660
Give me some time, General.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.960
Okay, I'm coming to you.

00:44:17.914 --> 00:44:23.461
- Grio, leave the control to me, now!
- I just opened the way for you.

00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:31.681
You are in control General.
Manual control activated.

00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:51.459
- We have to find a hiding place.
- Let's cross the river.

00:44:56.475 --> 00:44:58.477
They have a block on the bridge.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.521
Princess, you are being watched by a drone.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.137
- At what height?
- Nine km.

00:45:14.472 --> 00:45:17.476
Wait, I'll arrange it.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.920
Think, a little Riri, because you have to solve

00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:27.369
the equation that is equal to
with the relative speed.

00:45:27.514 --> 00:45:30.632
Riri, you can't make it
the drone without an oxygen mask.

00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:35.443
Oxygen level: 55%.

00:45:35.643 --> 00:45:38.466
Eight and a half kilometers.

00:45:39.463 --> 00:45:42.081
Oxygen level: 30%.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.478
Maximum acceleration. Regulation
Euler's point of view and I arrived.

00:45:56.468 --> 00:45:58.463
Oxygen level: 0%.

00:46:02.205 --> 00:46:04.003
The drone is no longer following you.

00:46:04.203 --> 00:46:07.113
Altitude:
At 500 km it drops.

00:46:07.313 --> 00:46:08.518
Rin, are you okay?

00:46:09.546 --> 00:46:10.386
Riri!

00:46:13.467 --> 00:46:14.694
I am fine.

00:46:17.554 --> 00:46:18.281
No.

00:46:19.049 --> 00:46:23.074
I have a special tradition
in three, two, one...

00:46:25.378 --> 00:46:26.248
Well done Riri!

00:46:34.478 --> 00:46:36.458
What happened to him;

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.468
What happened; Shuri! Shuri!

00:47:23.472 --> 00:47:26.073
The princess situation
is stable.

00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:28.743
She will regain consciousness soon.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.796
Take one more step
and I will kill you all.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.542
Put your gun down!

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.444
Kill the scientist.
I will take the witnesses.

00:48:15.468 --> 00:48:16.537
Understandable.

00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:19.316
It's blue;

00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:23.160
Kill the woman first.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.274
You don't want to mess with Namor.

00:50:10.458 --> 00:50:13.092
You are not worthy of my sword.

00:50:25.461 --> 00:50:27.170
Why are you late?

00:50:27.289 --> 00:50:29.898
We don't have time for bullshit.

00:50:38.478 --> 00:50:41.444
Perfect!

00:50:41.468 --> 00:50:43.479
- Wait!
- Enable translator.

00:50:44.459 --> 00:50:49.247
I am Shuri, Princess of Wakanda.
Take me to Namor.

00:50:49.447 --> 00:50:51.026
Don't bother the girl.

00:50:53.475 --> 00:50:55.481
"Should we capture them alive?"

00:50:56.478 --> 00:50:58.465
"Yes, Atuma."

00:51:14.474 --> 00:51:16.469
"Inhale."

00:51:24.475 --> 00:51:26.464
Shuri!

00:51:44.461 --> 00:51:47.205
Ross, Co.
Witnesses;

00:51:47.405 --> 00:51:49.770
No, but we think so
that they are Wakandans.

00:51:50.476 --> 00:51:54.475
- Langley says they're coming.
- Who called you?

00:51:55.478 --> 00:51:57.461
She.

00:51:59.477 --> 00:52:02.611
- Director de Fontaine.
- Seriously?

00:52:04.462 --> 00:52:06.453
They think they are Wakandans.

00:52:06.477 --> 00:52:11.452
We monitor everything.
That's why I called you.

00:52:11.476 --> 00:52:16.444
You look fine.
Are you done with the gym?

00:52:16.468 --> 00:52:20.498
- Yes, last year.
- Then let me ride a bike.

00:52:20.698 --> 00:52:23.442
I am the agent in charge.

00:52:23.466 --> 00:52:26.328
Well done. Would you mind
tell me what happened here?

00:52:26.754 --> 00:52:27.623
- Yes.
- Nice.

00:52:27.823 --> 00:52:30.327
Okay, so what happened.

00:52:30.901 --> 00:52:34.024
We thought it was a car accident,
but we could not find the car.

00:52:34.183 --> 00:52:36.861
- Was it like this when you came?
- Yes.

00:52:37.108 --> 00:52:41.457
We think someone took the car out
off the road and fell into the river.

00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:44.439
You can't be serious.

00:52:44.463 --> 00:52:48.446
To go to the laboratories immediately.
Send it to the NSA immediately.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:52.449
Ross, would you mind?
take me back to langley?

00:52:52.473 --> 00:52:56.714
- The trip is eight hours.
- We will talk about the case.

00:52:56.966 --> 00:52:58.453
I actually want too

00:52:58.477 --> 00:53:02.643
to apologize for some
things i said when we got married

00:53:05.469 --> 00:53:10.306
They are blue and have superpowers.

00:53:10.506 --> 00:53:14.441
They came out of the water above
on the backs of whales.

00:53:14.465 --> 00:53:19.443
I killed three of them,
But they got up again.

00:53:19.467 --> 00:53:23.281
I want to start right away
to search for the princess.

00:53:34.468 --> 00:53:35.479
Okay.

00:53:36.459 --> 00:53:40.452
You will be stripped of your position
leader of the Wakanda military

00:53:40.476 --> 00:53:44.462
and your status as a warrior.

00:53:48.462 --> 00:53:51.042
May I speak, Your Highness?

00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:52.971
Yes, you can talk.

00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:55.468
I beg you...

00:53:56.478 --> 00:53:58.478
I have given everything.

00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:03.439
Let me die to save
my country and my throne.

00:54:03.463 --> 00:54:05.443
I am begging you.

00:54:05.467 --> 00:54:09.479
- Let me make amends.
- Make amends?

00:54:10.459 --> 00:54:13.445
I don't know if my daughter
is she alive or dead

00:54:13.469 --> 00:54:17.462
Perhaps we are too hasty.

00:54:18.477 --> 00:54:23.442
She raised her spear against
of her husband for the sake of Wakanda.

00:54:23.466 --> 00:54:29.440
And where is her husband now?
A place he can go.

00:54:29.464 --> 00:54:33.448
Mine is with the ancestors.

00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:38.447
I am the queen of more
powerful nation in the world,

00:54:38.471 --> 00:54:42.443
and i lost my whole family!

00:54:42.467 --> 00:54:45.476
Didn't I give everything?

00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:57.476
Get up, general.

00:55:02.473 --> 00:55:08.451
I stood up for you when
killmonger took the throne.

00:55:08.475 --> 00:55:12.447
But you and the board members
council together you supported him,

00:55:12.471 --> 00:55:17.441
when I ran to Jabari for protection.

00:55:17.465 --> 00:55:21.480
I warned you not to take it
my daughter on this mission,

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.452
and you lost her.

00:55:24.476 --> 00:55:28.470
So today you are done.

00:56:15.467 --> 00:56:17.478
Are you here, Grio?

00:56:19.464 --> 00:56:21.448
Yes, my Queen.

00:56:21.472 --> 00:56:24.480
Were you with Suri when she was kidnapped?

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.445
Yes I was.

00:56:26.469 --> 00:56:29.446
You can spot
the chemotherapy pearls?

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:32.410
We found bullets all over Cambridge.

00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:34.845
The people of Wakanda
he was indeed in town.

00:56:35.045 --> 00:56:37.474
But how did they find out
who made the machine?

00:56:38.137 --> 00:56:40.054
As these are extreme
confidential information.

00:56:43.463 --> 00:56:46.446
Got a new ringtone?

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:50.988
- I have to answer, boss.
- Leave the formalities now. Answer it.

00:56:51.848 --> 00:56:56.674
Hello my love.
I'm with my boss.

00:56:56.874 --> 00:56:59.439
Yes now
- Which just left.

00:56:59.463 --> 00:57:03.257
I will work from home
and then I'll take a shower.

00:57:10.459 --> 00:57:13.237
- Everett Ross?
- Queen Ramonda?

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.618
What do you do with the chemical?
suri's pearl?

00:57:15.745 --> 00:57:20.443
I didn't know it was hers.
I found them at the crime scene.

00:57:20.467 --> 00:57:22.445
Do you have students at school?

00:57:22.469 --> 00:57:26.440
Suri tried to save her,
but they have both been kidnapped.

00:57:26.464 --> 00:57:31.442
Who was he kidnapped by?
SIA thinks it's you.

00:57:31.466 --> 00:57:35.457
I'm afraid they'll find out how I drove
Shuri and Okoye in the right direction.

00:57:35.481 --> 00:57:39.454
I want to help them, but
I need to know what's going on.

00:57:39.478 --> 00:57:42.449
There is a new one
global power in the game.

00:57:42.473 --> 00:57:46.635
The country we are watching or do you mean someone else?

00:57:46.855 --> 00:57:51.352
I can't say much more now.
Please let me know if the govt

00:57:51.493 --> 00:57:54.439
decide to act
based on her suspicions.

00:57:54.463 --> 00:57:55.479
Will do it.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.377
Listen, if there's anything I can do
to help, tell me.

00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:02.120
I owe Suri my life.

00:58:02.471 --> 00:58:06.451
Grio, is Suri wearing her earrings?

00:58:06.475 --> 00:58:13.458
They were lost in the North Atlantic
but her captors spoke Yucatecan.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.693
APPLICANT'S CAPITAL
"HAITI"

00:58:22.186 --> 00:58:23.988
Welcome.

00:58:30.175 --> 00:58:31.929
Do you want to speak to the manager?

00:58:39.168 --> 00:58:40.159
There she goes.

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.661
Very good...

00:58:50.173 --> 00:58:51.525
Good morning.

00:58:57.174 --> 00:59:01.039
Excuse me for a moment.

00:59:05.176 --> 00:59:07.149
Good morning.

00:59:07.173 --> 00:59:08.107
Good morning.

00:59:13.172 --> 00:59:16.147
Lady Queen Mother...

00:59:16.171 --> 00:59:18.889
Everything here is a lesson for children.

00:59:19.174 --> 00:59:24.315
They paint the walls, feed and care
the fish do whatever it takes.

00:59:24.515 --> 00:59:26.954
Some of my concepts are familiar

00:59:27.154 --> 00:59:29.493
but you use
different material now.

00:59:29.641 --> 00:59:32.891
Yes, we use what we can
to find here in Haiti.

00:59:34.182 --> 00:59:38.185
We missed you at Tsala's funeral.

00:59:49.184 --> 00:59:53.685
- Queen mother...
- It's been six years since you left.

00:59:54.172 --> 00:59:57.623
I thought you would attend
at least at the ceremony.

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:06.730
I was afraid, like the funeral
would put a definitive end to it.

01:00:06.898 --> 01:00:09.432
Nakia, daughter of Yaa.

01:00:11.093 --> 01:00:14.470
You will always be her daughter
Wakanda wherever you go.

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:19.021
You know death is not the end.

01:00:23.172 --> 01:00:24.363
Thanks

01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:31.454
How is everyone at home?

01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:35.507
- Suri was kidnapped.
- How why?

01:00:35.707 --> 01:00:39.266
You have infiltrated many countries before.

01:00:39.466 --> 01:00:41.096
It has been a long time.

01:00:41.535 --> 01:00:43.090
I was a different person then.

01:00:43.185 --> 01:00:48.824
I need someone who can find her
and save her without being seen.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.181
Who would dare
challenge Wakanda?

01:00:54.182 --> 01:00:57.148
- Oh my god.
- Breathe.

01:00:57.172 --> 01:01:01.255
Don't ask me to breathe.
Where the hell are we?

01:01:02.174 --> 01:01:06.162
- I am not sure.
- Oh my god, what is this?

01:01:06.186 --> 01:01:10.159
Their larvae emit light.
Just calm down.

01:01:10.183 --> 01:01:14.018
There is no new black panther
where can you call

01:01:14.085 --> 01:01:17.778
No. It doesn't work that way anymore.

01:01:18.166 --> 01:01:20.164
Black Panther is in the past.

01:01:20.188 --> 01:01:24.173
Now that we've been kidnapped,
is there no black panther?

01:01:28.545 --> 01:01:29.619
Princess.

01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:33.165
The members of the royal family

01:01:33.474 --> 01:01:35.765
here they wear traditional clothes.

01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:37.648
Do you understand what he says;

01:01:42.168 --> 01:01:45.582
- They made it for me.
- This is so bad.

01:01:46.274 --> 01:01:48.459
It's in every movie.
Princess Leia,

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:53.261
Belle from "Beauty and the Beast"
the white girl from "Indiana Jones".

01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:56.182
You will be surprised to see what you need
to wear to the Warriors' Feast.

01:02:02.184 --> 01:02:04.173
Come with me.

01:02:05.768 --> 01:02:09.864
- You won't leave me here, will you?
- I'll be back.

01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:14.421
I'll be back. Calm down.

01:02:21.188 --> 01:02:22.723

YUCATAN, MEXICO

01:02:37.168 --> 01:02:41.151
- Good evening lady.
- How can I help you;

01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:44.299
My name is Maria Aldana.
I am a student of Merida.

01:02:44.399 --> 01:02:46.554
I do not care.
Go away please

01:02:46.754 --> 01:02:50.679
Yes of course. I don't want you
offend...give me a moment.

01:02:50.938 --> 01:02:53.493
My teacher mentioned a survey
to which you replied that you have met...

01:02:58.171 --> 01:03:00.189
... an inconceivable man.

01:03:01.169 --> 01:03:04.337
No one wants to talk to strangers.

01:03:05.184 --> 01:03:07.177
- I'm begging you.
- Disappear.

01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:11.022
I met him too.

01:03:22.168 --> 01:03:27.148
Sometimes I saw a winged man

01:03:27.172 --> 01:03:31.188
in the beach.
We thought it was a soul

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:37.162
of Kukulkan, the winged one
snake god,

01:03:37.186 --> 01:03:41.152
which rules in him
the world and the under...

01:03:41.176 --> 01:03:44.188
I want to go to this beach.

01:03:45.168 --> 01:03:50.147
I warn you.
Kukulkan was there a lot

01:03:50.171 --> 01:03:52.165
before you and me

01:03:52.189 --> 01:03:58.180
Others sought him and brought him
in their hearts bad faith

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.890
and they never came back.
They disappeared into the depths

01:04:02.888 --> 01:04:03.858
forever.

01:04:23.177 --> 01:04:26.170
Princess.
Welcome.

01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:30.182
Please come closer.

01:04:37.188 --> 01:04:41.930
- This is beautiful.
- It belonged to my mother.

01:04:51.186 --> 01:04:54.671
All artifacts
is from Central America,

01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:57.965
mainly of the 16th century.

01:04:58.188 --> 01:05:00.977
Have you lived since then?

01:05:02.182 --> 01:05:04.442
Your mother was human

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:09.252
It was, but something else happened.

01:05:09.452 --> 01:05:11.753
- How?
- How?

01:05:12.529 --> 01:05:14.752
the important
it's not the how but the why.

1571
ZAMA,
YUCATAN

01:05:26.466 --> 01:05:29.299
My mother's people
were evicted from their farms

01:05:29.704 --> 01:05:32.798
because of the Spanish invaders
who brought smallpox with them.

01:05:33.172 --> 01:05:36.178
Hate for the language
and doctrine from another world.

01:05:38.124 --> 01:05:41.850
They had to face starvation,
war and disease

01:05:42.278 --> 01:05:44.182
My folks turned to Chuck...

01:05:45.177 --> 01:05:48.238
... the God of rain and wealth.

01:05:49.968 --> 01:05:52.105
Chuck showed us the way
of our spirit,

01:05:53.526 --> 01:05:55.372
how he could save his people.

01:05:59.724 --> 01:06:03.506
Chuck gave them a plant that
grows on a blue stone

01:06:16.184 --> 01:06:19.407
My mother was pregnant
to me at the time

01:06:19.616 --> 01:06:23.864
and he did not dare to eat
from the plant so as not to lose me.

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:25.189
No, I'm pregnant.

01:06:26.169 --> 01:06:27.746
But the spiritual was reassuring.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.640
Your child is sick.

01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:40.968
This might save him.

01:06:42.074 --> 01:06:45.091
Your child will be
the first born in our new home.

01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:47.807
Think of this gift as a promise

01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:51.372
that he will be our new king

01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:02.162
Everyone got sick.

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:08.174
Thus their life and existence ended there.

01:07:19.184 --> 01:07:22.586
The plant took away their ability
to breathe the oxygen of the land.

01:07:22.786 --> 01:07:25.998
But he allowed them to breathe
in the sea.

01:07:29.186 --> 01:07:31.708
They settled in the ocean

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:35.175
away from wars and diseases.

01:07:37.189 --> 01:07:39.085
Come on!

01:08:04.178 --> 01:08:06.899
That's where my mother gave birth to me...

01:08:07.099 --> 01:08:10.177
...and I became the first man
who was born in Talokan.

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:15.162
The plant gave me winged ankles
and ears pointing to the sky.

01:08:15.186 --> 01:08:16.905
I was a mutant.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.187
I was flying in the sky.
But my age has slowed.

01:08:21.633 --> 01:08:24.156
And I could breathe
the air of my ancestors.

01:08:25.169 --> 01:08:26.542
My mother was getting old

01:08:28.169 --> 01:08:31.625
and mourned the life he knew

01:08:33.179 --> 01:08:35.562
and died heartbroken.

01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:42.304
She made me promise her
that I would bury her in her homeland.

01:08:47.178 --> 01:08:51.188
But I wasn't ready
for what I would see there.

01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:59.189
Whose son is this?

01:09:13.184 --> 01:09:15.511
Get ready!

01:09:32.179 --> 01:09:36.570
You are the devil
Satan's seed.

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:40.445
A Spanish priest cursed me
as she was dying in my arms.

01:09:40.745 --> 01:09:43.161
He called me...

01:09:43.185 --> 01:09:46.169
"The Loveless Child".

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:49.742
"Child without love"..

01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.733
And from his words I got my name

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.153
"Namor".

01:09:58.177 --> 01:10:02.161
Because I had no love
for the world of earth.

01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:05.153
Why are you telling me all this?

01:10:05.177 --> 01:10:10.155
To understand why you should
to kill the researcher.

01:10:10.355 --> 01:10:11.890
What if we take her to Wakanda?

01:10:13.169 --> 01:10:18.549
Let us go. I give you my word
that the girl will stay in my hometown.

01:10:18.787 --> 01:10:21.601
- I can't risk it.
- Then hold me.

01:10:23.183 --> 01:10:26.153
I would like to see your nation.

01:10:26.177 --> 01:10:29.471
You can't go like that.

01:10:31.897 --> 01:10:34.615
Your body will go into immediate shock.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:36.960
Your blood will be poisoned

01:10:37.689 --> 01:10:41.349
and the water pressure will break
every bone in your body,

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.193
or you can wear a suit.
We have many options.

01:10:50.185 --> 01:10:52.187
Stay close to me.

01:11:56.168 --> 01:11:58.170

But now you see
what should i protect

01:15:15.009 --> 01:15:18.754
Your hunch was right, Nakia
I spotted Suri's earrings.

01:15:52.586 --> 01:15:55.177
The signal originates
from an underwater cave

01:15:55.527 --> 01:15:58.749
in depth approx
140 meters from the surface.

It comes from an underwater cave.

If it's down there, I'm sure
that I will meet resistance.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:10.676
How do you want me to act?

01:16:11.585 --> 01:16:15.550
Take back the princess
by any means possible.

01:16:15.952 --> 01:16:19.416
I'll try to pull Namor out.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.467
You are the first person from
surface that came to Talocan.

01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:00.964
Please accept this
as a token of my gratitude.

01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:10.273
It is made from the plant
who saved Talocan.

01:17:12.596 --> 01:17:14.647
You are young, Princess.

01:17:14.847 --> 01:17:16.691
If you get old like me...

01:17:17.183 --> 01:17:20.732
You understand that we all lose
everyone we love

01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:24.600
But when I lost my brother,
the feeling was different.

01:17:25.172 --> 01:17:26.718
He suffered in silence.

01:17:26.918 --> 01:17:29.742
And when he finally asked me for help,
I couldn't give it to him.

01:17:30.599 --> 01:17:33.567
How does that make sense?

01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:36.805
My ancestors gave
gifts and skills...

01:17:37.915 --> 01:17:40.228
to help save
my brother and I couldn't.

01:17:40.428 --> 01:17:42.845
Why;

01:17:44.604 --> 01:17:47.590
I don't have an answer to this question.

01:17:49.595 --> 01:17:52.054
As my ancestors used to say:

01:17:52.586 --> 01:17:55.969
"Only the most broken people
they can become great leaders"

01:17:59.597 --> 01:18:02.120
I admire what you have done here

01:18:04.794 --> 01:18:07.046
and how you protect
your people?

01:18:07.594 --> 01:18:10.571
But as the princess of Wakanda,

01:18:10.595 --> 01:18:14.575
I can't let you kill her.

01:18:14.599 --> 01:18:19.566
My nation will not rest
until I come back.

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:25.599
I'm not leaving without her.
We need to settle this peacefully.

01:18:29.593 --> 01:18:32.054
The issue is no longer about the scientist.

01:18:33.588 --> 01:18:37.551
For centuries nations have conquered
and enslave people like us

01:18:38.592 --> 01:18:40.286
only for our resources.

01:18:41.589 --> 01:18:43.428
Since the day I buried my mother,

01:18:43.628 --> 01:18:48.067
I prepare my people
for the time they will come to invade

01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:52.591
And this instrument
it's a sign that the time has come.

01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:59.274
I need to know if Wakanda
is he an ally or an enemy..

01:18:59.587 --> 01:19:01.599
There is no middle ground.

01:19:03.595 --> 01:19:07.578
So you plan to start
war all over the world...

01:19:07.602 --> 01:19:12.566
and you want wakanda to help you?
This is madness.

01:19:13.258 --> 01:19:17.277
No nation would plunder
Wakanda if given the chance.

01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:23.564
If we ally, we will protect
each other from the attacks.

01:19:23.588 --> 01:19:27.605
Once they stop threatening us,
then we will eliminate them.

01:19:28.585 --> 01:19:30.971
The scientist
will return to Wakanda.

01:19:31.686 --> 01:19:34.254
And what if Wakanda refuses?

01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:37.017
The researcher will die...

01:19:38.686 --> 01:19:41.521
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

01:19:41.721 --> 01:19:44.315
- Are you going to attack my country?
- Yes.

01:19:44.602 --> 01:19:50.641
Listen to me. Wakanda will not win
never a war against the Talokan.

01:19:55.234 --> 01:19:56.780
He wants to offer you something,

01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:57.980
the Kukulkan.

01:20:01.606 --> 01:20:07.572
I heard you that night you were
with your mother near the river.

01:20:07.596 --> 01:20:10.588
You said you wanted to burn the world down.

01:20:16.594 --> 01:20:19.594
Let's burn him together.

LANGLEY VIRGINIA.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.277
Queen Raimonda refuses
to sell us vibranium.

01:20:30.589 --> 01:20:33.786
And now they kidnapped the young woman
who made the machine.

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:39.354
Sincerely, Riri Williams
he is a genius with good performance.

01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:43.118
Wakanda recruited her.
With the program they created.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:46.156
But you sent an army at night.

01:20:46.356 --> 01:20:50.360
To arrest
the princess of a superpower.

01:20:52.595 --> 01:20:55.937
The president,
he wants to attack Wakanda.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.601
- What kind of aggressive action?
- Destabilization.

01:21:02.588 --> 01:21:06.658
Special Officer Ross
is the expert.

01:21:06.893 --> 01:21:08.363
What do you think, Ross?

01:21:08.683 --> 01:21:11.412
My sources tell me
that something else is involved.

01:21:11.727 --> 01:21:14.189
- Another nation?
- I do not know maybe.

01:21:14.389 --> 01:21:16.399
You have to give me
enough time to investigate it.

01:21:16.516 --> 01:21:19.598
Otherwise, we will meet
at war against a country,

01:21:19.728 --> 01:21:22.097
which we cannot even comprehend
military capabilities.

01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:28.124
- Ms. Director?
- He's an expert.

01:21:28.299 --> 01:21:30.793
I think the attack
in Wanda it would be wrong.

01:21:37.587 --> 01:21:39.589
- You are welcome;
- We have a problem..

KIP VERDE

01:22:00.602 --> 01:22:03.566
Is my daughter alive?

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:05.582
The princess is well and alive.

01:22:05.606 --> 01:22:11.653
He asked to be transferred to Talocan
and it will remain there for a while.
808
01:22:14,605 ​​--&gt; 01:22:18,566
What can I give you in exchange?

01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:21.582
- There is nothing.
- I have a different opinion

01:22:22.843 --> 01:22:26.357
Americans think
in charge of Wakanda

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.515
for the attack on the research ship.

01:22:29.083 --> 01:22:31.375
Give me back my daughter
and the researcher

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.252
otherwise I will tell them about you.

01:22:41.603 --> 01:22:44.367
If you tell the Americans about us,

01:22:45.983 --> 01:22:48.576
Or try to find us,

01:22:49.374 --> 01:22:52.704
or see even a single ship
of Wakanda in the ocean...

01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:55.156
i will kill the princess...

01:22:56.591 --> 01:23:00.817
and then I will come to Wakanda
and i will kill you

01:23:09.596 --> 01:23:11.572
So what happened?

01:23:12.977 --> 01:23:17.725
She wants to declare war on her world
surface. He asked me to help him.

01:23:21.605 --> 01:23:26.585
We have to think.
We will never leave here.

01:23:38.594 --> 01:23:41.598
- Throw your spear!
- Kill the princess!

01:23:47.592 --> 01:23:49.349
Throw away your knife.

01:23:49.649 --> 01:23:50.503
You

01:23:51.706 --> 01:23:52.793
I'll kill you.

01:23:52.993 --> 01:23:54.800
Let her go

01:23:55.028 --> 01:23:56.797
and I won't kill you.

01:23:59.597 --> 01:24:03.594
Suri, wave your hand.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.605
Are you ok;

01:24:11.585 --> 01:24:14.709
Give me your beads!
I can save her.

01:24:14.909 --> 01:24:18.134
Suri, I don't know who she is,
but we must hear what he has to say.

01:24:18.475 --> 01:24:21.152
Look, I hit her with a sonic.
it is lethal from this distance.

01:24:21.299 --> 01:24:22.930
he will not be able to survive.

01:24:23.235 --> 01:24:25.601
You do not understand.
This will lead to war.

01:25:09.592 --> 01:25:12.597
- Have you knocked?
- No.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.788
Thanks.

01:25:16.047 --> 01:25:17.232
You are welcome.

01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:21.597
Griot, take us to Wakanda.

01:25:25.595 --> 01:25:27.592
What happened my daughter?

01:25:29.588 --> 01:25:31.552
Here come the Wakandans,

01:25:32.389 --> 01:25:34.325
and they took her.

01:25:36.594 --> 01:25:38.604
Kukulkan...

01:25:40.604 --> 01:25:44.554
... can you save me?

01:25:58.328 --> 01:25:59.385
Passed away;

01:26:01.593 --> 01:26:02.601
Yes.

01:26:11.847 --> 01:26:13.892
Rest in Peace.

01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:17.797
They came...

01:26:18.509 --> 01:26:22.342
while you were talking to the queen?

01:26:23.589 --> 01:26:27.242
She was not to be trusted.

01:26:27.587 --> 01:26:30.724
The princess saw our house.

01:26:31.024 --> 01:26:33.441
What will stop them?

01:26:33.928 --> 01:26:36.128
to attack the Taloscans?

01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:39.732
I will stop them.

01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:15.603
Rise up, Taloscans!

01:27:17.606 --> 01:27:19.986
Arm yourself, Taloscans!

01:27:25.451 --> 01:27:27.257
It blinded me...

01:27:27.557 --> 01:27:28.785
the hope...

01:27:29.315 --> 01:27:30.796
of the alliance.

01:27:32.589 --> 01:27:33.550
Me too...

01:27:34.527 --> 01:27:36.646
I put us in danger...

01:27:37.345 --> 01:27:39.133
all of you.

01:27:40.128 --> 01:27:41.107
The Taloscan...

01:27:41.551 --> 01:27:42.906
It won't change...

01:27:43.106 --> 01:27:44.593
his place, once again.

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:46.513
Namora.

01:27:47.785 --> 01:27:48.562
Let's go.

01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:53.603
When we're done with them...

01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:58.882
they will never think...

01:27:59.365 --> 01:28:01.029
again to approach

01:28:01.555 --> 01:28:02.570
the Taloscan.

01:28:04.601 --> 01:28:06.652
Arm yourself, Taloscans!

01:28:18.308 --> 01:28:23.733
We're glad you're back, princess.
The town has been tense since you left.

01:28:24.303 --> 01:28:28.190
Reinforce sound barriers
in all directions.

01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:31.137
- Princess?
- Neka.

01:28:33.295 --> 01:28:35.020
Thank the ancestors.

01:28:35.306 --> 01:28:38.962
I just wanted to give you these.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:44.310
No, keep them.
They may be needed soon.

01:28:45.292 --> 01:28:47.261
Is that where you got it from?

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:54.282
It is true that you saw down
from the waters an empire?

01:28:54.306 --> 01:28:56.291
Yes.

01:28:57.295 --> 01:29:02.177
It's very nice,
but they are dangerous, Anika.

01:29:22.297 --> 01:29:28.093
So Miss Riri Williams?
What do you think of 'Wakanda'?

01:29:28.304 --> 01:29:32.293
The stories don't do this place justice.

01:29:33.307 --> 01:29:37.311
It's great here,
but I really want to go home.

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:41.539
- Be patient.
- Can I take my mother?

01:29:47.307 --> 01:29:51.700
The Princess was saved by Nakia.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.307
Glory to Hanuman.

01:29:55.311 --> 01:29:59.288
The spy saved Wakanda, again.

01:29:59.312 --> 01:30:04.312
The queen probably
he will reward her with exile.

01:30:06.302 --> 01:30:07.782
Okoye, welcome.

01:30:10.299 --> 01:30:12.293
Thank you my sister.

01:30:13.304 --> 01:30:17.281
After the attack of Thanos,
you left without saying anything

01:30:17.305 --> 01:30:19.018
It hurt me.

01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:26.271
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.

01:30:28.482 --> 01:30:29.825
It wasn't easy for me.

01:30:30.294 --> 01:30:35.304
He was the King
and Black Panther, for everyone.

01:30:36.299 --> 01:30:37.695
But for me...

01:30:44.693 --> 01:30:46.533
... was everything.

01:30:47.313 --> 01:30:49.857
My T'Chala.

01:30:51.293 --> 01:30:54.402
When he was taken from me so suddenly.

01:30:55.209 --> 01:30:56.839
I had to get away.

01:30:57.793 --> 01:30:59.698
and pick up my pieces.

01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:07.446
I couldn't go on with my life
as if nothing had happened.

01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:26.630
We are under attack.

01:31:34.293 --> 01:31:35.311
Keep it.

01:31:42.282 --> 01:31:43.192
Let's help them!

01:31:43.392 --> 01:31:44.783
Are you ok;

01:31:45.305 --> 01:31:47.470
Griot, activate defense.

01:31:48.017 --> 01:31:50.843
- Suri, where are you?
- To the lab, I'm coming.

01:31:51.002 --> 01:31:52.301
Stay where you are, it's an order!

01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:54.779
I'm with Anika, mom. We can
to provide air support.

01:31:54.846 --> 01:31:56.351
Anika, don't let her go
to leave the laboratory.

01:31:56.483 --> 01:31:59.299
Mom, I can't hear you.
You're on vacation. See you later.

01:32:01.841 --> 01:32:04.200
- Did you hang up on the Queen?
- I hung up on my mother.

01:32:04.374 --> 01:32:05.611
There is a difference.
Come on, lets go.

01:32:37.313 --> 01:32:39.313
Invaders!

01:32:45.305 --> 01:32:48.310
Mum! Mum!

01:32:51.749 --> 01:32:53.559
Turn back!

01:32:57.296 --> 01:33:00.048
Paramedics submit
in sound hypnosis.

01:33:02.305 --> 01:33:04.097
Take the child!

01:33:04.397 --> 01:33:07.293
- Close your ears, General.
- Yes, that's what I do.

01:33:53.304 --> 01:33:56.298
- Can I help;
- Come here quickly.

01:34:02.305 --> 01:34:04.292
Warrior!

01:34:06.298 --> 01:34:08.481
Cross your arms, kid.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.311
Nakia.
We're going to find your mom, okay?

01:34:28.302 --> 01:34:29.713
The fisherman!

01:34:34.292 --> 01:34:36.940
We dropped the Palace defenses.

01:34:37.284 --> 01:34:39.238
The rest is up to you.

01:35:58.292 --> 01:35:58.808
Aid!

01:35:59.874 --> 01:36:00.530
Aid!

01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:20.562
- He is very fast.
- And faster in the water.

01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:50.300
- System Bypass.
- I'm not going to leave you.

01:37:07.292 --> 01:37:09.302
- You see him;
- Yes, there it is.

01:37:23.291 --> 01:37:24.690
Go away, my daughter.

01:37:25.299 --> 01:37:28.292
- What if I leave you?
- Run!

01:37:42.309 --> 01:37:44.294
Let's go now!

01:38:45.191 --> 01:38:46.276
Help the girl.

01:38:52.508 --> 01:38:53.635
This happened because of her.

01:38:57.291 --> 01:39:01.158
I'll be back in a week
with all my army.

01:39:01.458 --> 01:39:04.630
Join us to fight.

01:39:04.757 --> 01:39:07.980
Or I'll wipe out Wakanda
from the face of the earth.

01:39:08.297 --> 01:39:09.369
Come my queen!

01:39:11.058 --> 01:39:11.580
Mother.

01:39:12.086 --> 01:39:13.016
Hold her back!

01:39:13.116 --> 01:39:13.792
Mother.

01:39:14.593 --> 01:39:16.107
Bury your dead.

01:39:17.784 --> 01:39:19.777
And mourn those you lost.

01:39:22.297 --> 01:39:24.045
You are the queen now.

01:39:29.314 --> 01:39:32.307
Let me! Mum!

01:39:40.314 --> 01:39:44.312
Mum!

01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:48.249
Wake up my queen.

01:39:49.307 --> 01:39:51.234
Let me try.

01:39:53.306 --> 01:39:56.303
Help her!
Mum.

01:39:59.299 --> 01:40:01.275
Wake up!

01:40:01.299 --> 01:40:03.311
Passed away.

01:40:46.312 --> 01:40:52.023
Condolences from the country
of Jabari for your loss.

01:40:58.307 --> 01:41:04.301
You must mourn accordingly
with ancestral rites.

01:41:07.058 --> 01:41:09.608
- Don't bother with the techniques.
- Why are you here;

01:41:11.926 --> 01:41:17.336
I promised your brother that I would
I would give you advice and protect you.

01:41:19.308 --> 01:41:22.303
But now I need it
your advice today.

01:41:25.309 --> 01:41:29.676
The elders of your tribe
they came to me with a proposal.

01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:35.538
They want to evacuate the city
and set up camp at Jabari.

01:41:35.738 --> 01:41:39.055
And now you want him to listen
the opinion of a little girl.

01:41:39.255 --> 01:41:41.772
To mock tradition?

01:41:45.305 --> 01:41:47.301
The world...

01:41:48.303 --> 01:41:54.938
The world has deprived you of much.
You can no longer be considered a little girl.

01:41:58.769 --> 01:42:03.086
It is in the interest of my people
to know which option you prefer.

01:42:04.306 --> 01:42:07.290
The elders are desperate.

01:42:07.314 --> 01:42:10.303
The city is vulnerable.

01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:17.304
If you help them,
they will owe you a lot.

01:42:19.308 --> 01:42:22.298
And what does your heart say?

01:42:24.314 --> 01:42:27.306
Where does it close?

01:42:28.311 --> 01:42:32.058
I just buried the last one
person who knew me well.

01:42:35.298 --> 01:42:37.310
My heart is buried with her.

01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:18.318
The oil is about to spoil.

01:43:18.447 --> 01:43:21.370
- What are you doing here;
- I am hungry. And...

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:25.278
A tragedy struck the international community.
Sources can confirm,

01:43:25.302 --> 01:43:28.849
the death of Queen Raimonda,
Lumumba's daughter.

01:43:29.293 --> 01:43:31.125
The Western Allies blame...

01:43:31.297 --> 01:43:33.431
civil strife...
as a possible cause of death...

01:43:35.298 --> 01:43:38.174
So, do you have any comments?

01:43:40.627 --> 01:43:43.562
I wonder what else
your friends are hiding from you.

01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:45.556
What are you talking about;

01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:49.434
I don't have any unauthorized ones
contact with the kingdom of Wakanda'

01:43:52.084 --> 01:43:53.434
What about beads?

01:43:54.305 --> 01:43:57.201
- Here you go;
- The beads?

01:43:57.674 --> 01:44:00.271
There is an interception
before you deny anything.

01:44:00.295 --> 01:44:03.794
I am aware of every conversation...

01:44:04.061 --> 01:44:07.339
that you had between and the call,
that you committed treason with the queen.

01:44:07.888 --> 01:44:08.781
May he rest in peace.

01:44:09.203 --> 01:44:11.445
But that's good, good for us.

01:44:11.691 --> 01:44:16.103
The Wakandans saved my life.
They are good people.

01:44:16.613 --> 01:44:20.134
Have you thought about what they could do?

01:44:20.764 --> 01:44:22.224
Have you thought about what we do?

01:44:22.376 --> 01:44:25.422
If the United States were alone
country in the world with vibranium?

01:44:26.445 --> 01:44:29.912
I have actually dreamed of this.

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:36.335
- Put, please...
- Director de Fontaine.

01:44:39.557 --> 01:44:42.499
Your mother protected me
as if I were her child.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.227
It's the least I can do
to try to return the favor.

01:44:47.599 --> 01:44:51.643
- We need to weaken him.
- Even if it weakens...

01:44:51.724 --> 01:44:52.901
the problem remains.

01:44:53.201 --> 01:44:56.657
Black Panther ever
he didn't let Wakanda down.

01:44:56.957 --> 01:44:58.603
Didn't you say Black Panther left?

01:45:08.591 --> 01:45:10.501
My brother is dead.

01:45:12.338 --> 01:45:14.588
But that doesn't mean
that the Black Panther is gone.

01:45:32.584 --> 01:45:37.090
Griot, start benchmarking.

01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:40.491
to make an artificial parasite

01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:45.570
to put it in the fibers of the bracelet.

01:45:45.594 --> 01:45:47.032
Yes, Princess.

01:45:49.606 --> 01:45:53.242
Since these were cultivated
in vibranium-rich soil.

01:45:53.606 --> 01:45:57.898
There may be similarities between
that we can take advantage of.

01:45:58.098 --> 01:45:59.598
As you wish Princess.

01:46:04.146 --> 01:46:07.758
- Upload my brother's DNA too.
- Uploading it now.

01:46:39.269 --> 01:46:40.361
Why don't they look alike?

01:46:40.583 --> 01:46:42.734
The physiology is completely different.

01:46:43.261 --> 01:46:45.775
None of them fly either
she has pointy ears like him.

01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:49.349
The women who guarded us
they put water in their mouths and throats.

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:51.280
That's what they did.

01:46:51.558 --> 01:46:53.932
There are many organizations
which do not need gills

01:46:54.078 --> 01:46:56.728
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

01:46:57.137 --> 01:47:02.240
For example the jellyfish.
Absorbs oxygen through the skin.

01:47:04.036 --> 01:47:05.605
This process is called diffusion.

01:47:30.685 --> 01:47:34.806
Every day that goes by without us choosing
some area is a wasted day.

01:47:35.045 --> 01:47:38.349
We have to deal with Namor
before bringing his warriors here.

01:47:38.613 --> 01:47:41.232
How do you treat a person?
who has so much power?

01:47:42.625 --> 01:47:45.040
In the attack before the plane was shot down,
went back into the water.

01:47:45.574 --> 01:47:47.180
Maybe he can draw power from her?

01:47:47.406 --> 01:47:50.684
It breathes air and absorbs
oxygen from water.

01:47:51.317 --> 01:47:53.940
If we find a way to keep him
dry will not be strong.

01:47:54.349 --> 01:47:55.719
This is.

01:47:55.919 --> 01:48:00.545
Grio, we have to move
the battle in a steam room.

01:48:00.745 --> 01:48:03.571
- This happens;
- Yes, it is possible.

01:48:03.771 --> 01:48:06.576
You will help us trap him.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.382
Please show the missus
Williams her workplace.

01:48:09.939 --> 01:48:10.766
Please come from here.

01:48:14.583 --> 01:48:17.237
How old were you when you did?
your first machine?

01:48:17.437 --> 01:48:18.528
Three years old.

01:48:18.781 --> 01:48:22.369
My stepfather was a car mechanic
and he wanted to build airplanes.

01:48:22.618 --> 01:48:25.317
He gave me tools
and let me work.

01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:32.751
- Who taught you?
- My big brother.

01:48:35.585 --> 01:48:39.105
I was the tip of the spear
of the Wakanda military.

01:48:39.435 --> 01:48:41.788
This doesn't suit me at all.

01:48:41.988 --> 01:48:46.805
Besides, I'm a citizen now.
I surrendered my gun.

01:48:47.303 --> 01:48:49.429
I also made you a new spear.

01:48:50.597 --> 01:48:53.301
- New;
- Yes.

01:48:53.603 --> 01:48:58.331
- And what did you call this thing?
- The Midnight Angel.

01:48:58.928 --> 01:49:02.435
- The Midnight Angel?
- Listen to me, Okoya.

01:49:02.635 --> 01:49:07.987
It has potential. Sister,
You must be ready when I call you.

01:49:09.822 --> 01:49:10.606
I am begging you.

01:49:14.603 --> 01:49:17.964
- Suri.
- Yes?

01:49:19.595 --> 01:49:21.600
How many of these did you make?

01:49:23.585 --> 01:49:25.581
I was looking for you in Jabari barracks.

01:49:25.781 --> 01:49:30.285
- I won't leave my house.
- You have a revolutionary spirit.

01:49:30.485 --> 01:49:33.592
- Why did you join the warriors?
- Why are you interested;

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:43.678
I still have the desire to fight.

01:49:43.878 --> 01:49:50.445
Tell me, Anika, daughter of Kiana,
do you still have the will to fight?

01:49:50.745 --> 01:49:52.596
What do you have in mind;

01:50:16.605 --> 01:50:21.884
Grio, what's the success rate?

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:24.621
98.7%, Princess.

01:50:25.228 --> 01:50:27.887
Would you like me to print?
the heart shaped herb?

01:50:30.605 --> 01:50:33.594
Hello, Suri.

01:50:34.907 --> 01:50:37.224
I thought you were going back to Haiti.

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:39.956
I'm still Wakandan.

01:50:43.972 --> 01:50:48.879
So that's what you're working on.

01:50:49.588 --> 01:50:50.573
Yes.

01:50:50.597 --> 01:50:52.968
What do you have here now?

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:58.579
It's an opportunity for Wakanda to have
back her patron.

01:50:59.587 --> 01:51:03.780
This will be the greatest gift

01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:07.601
and from the discovery of Basinga.

01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:14.560
We'll find out soon enough.
Come.

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:18.831
- Gray?
- Yes, Princess.

01:51:19.031 --> 01:51:20.031
Print it out.

01:51:23.595 --> 01:51:27.587
- How will we know if it worked or not?
- It will shine!

01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:37.949
You did it!

01:51:42.592 --> 01:51:45.550
Let's not light incense
about the ancestors?

01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:49.387
Only the Goddess Bast knows how they got there
the ancestors in this workshop.

01:51:58.604 --> 01:52:02.200
- Surely I won't bury you?
- Yes.

01:52:02.946 --> 01:52:07.049
I want you to be able to reach
in my chest if I have a seizure.

01:52:07.377 --> 01:52:09.206
Failure;

01:52:09.605 --> 01:52:12.868
He's kidding, right?

01:52:14.601 --> 01:52:16.113
So;

01:52:21.994 --> 01:52:25.250
Allow me to leave this
the heart-shaped herb

01:52:25.450 --> 01:52:28.692
to give you
the power of the Black Panther

01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:31.774
and take you to the Realm of the Ancestors.

01:52:34.138 --> 01:52:35.177
Raimonda

01:52:35.724 --> 01:52:40.591
please come to your daughter.

01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:51.597
Mother;

01:54:04.591 --> 01:54:08.019
- Ticks?
- Cousin;

01:54:08.676 --> 01:54:09.284
How;

01:54:09.484 --> 01:54:12.439
The important thing is not
the how but the why, right?

01:54:13.594 --> 01:54:16.620
- You chose me.
- No, I didn't.

01:54:17.332 --> 01:54:18.686
I would never choose you.

01:54:18.886 --> 01:54:22.318
- Why did you take the herb?
- To see my family.

01:54:22.576 --> 01:54:23.431
No, that's nonsense.

01:54:23.631 --> 01:54:26.999
You didn't think that the Ancestral Kingdom
it would be real, right?

01:54:30.267 --> 01:54:33.378
- No.
- Then why did you take it?

01:54:35.419 --> 01:54:36.607
You don't have to lie to me.

01:54:36.807 --> 01:54:40.628
- To become strong.
- Get stronger why?

01:54:42.601 --> 01:54:47.592
You see; We look alike
more than you think.

01:54:49.926 --> 01:54:51.943
You took it to get revenge
the ancestors.

01:54:52.134 --> 01:54:53.329
I'm not like you.

01:54:53.605 --> 01:54:55.911
You got it for yourself.
You consume the potion and burn the rest.

01:54:56.566 --> 01:54:58.006
Then you destroyed what was left.

01:54:58.604 --> 01:55:03.365
An unworthy king
who is afraid of being replaced.

01:55:04.402 --> 01:55:05.423
A coward.

01:55:05.623 --> 01:55:09.352
I had the courage to do what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

01:55:10.811 --> 01:55:14.403
How many people have I protected from you?
in Wakanda before I ascended the throne.

01:55:15.587 --> 01:55:21.299
Panthers were cowards before me
and before T'Challa.

01:55:21.467 --> 01:55:24.567
Don't mention my brother.
He's dead because of you.

01:55:24.591 --> 01:55:28.563
Burn the herb,
leaving us vulnerable.

01:55:28.587 --> 01:55:33.573
Namor came and killed my mother.
You are responsible for her death.

01:55:33.597 --> 01:55:39.563
Do not blame me.
And don't underestimate your mother.

01:55:39.587 --> 01:55:43.605
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young woman from the lost tribe.

01:55:44.585 --> 01:55:48.564
Your father was a hypocrite.

01:55:48.588 --> 01:55:53.603
He would have killed the girl.
He killed his own brother.

01:55:54.583 --> 01:55:57.552
T'Challa was noble.

01:55:59.583 --> 01:56:03.569
You let his killer live.

01:56:03.593 --> 01:56:06.592
And you are here standing.

01:56:10.598 --> 01:56:13.287
Will you be as noble as your brother?

01:56:13.487 --> 01:56:15.368
Or you will do the right thing...

01:56:16.733 --> 01:56:17.564
...like me;

01:56:19.599 --> 01:56:21.603
Are you ok;
1123
01:56:22,603 ​​--&gt; 01:56:24,389
Are you ok;

01:56:26.596 --> 01:56:29.584
Who did you see?

01:56:33.586 --> 01:56:34.602
Nobody.

01:56:37.593 --> 01:56:42.205
- What happens;
- I failed. Did not work.

01:56:43.130 --> 01:56:43.688
Shuri...

01:56:45.603 --> 01:56:49.094
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

01:56:49.276 --> 01:56:51.615
I did everything I had to do.
I remade the herb.

01:56:51.984 --> 01:56:53.904
- Okay.
- I just did the stupid ritual

01:56:54.041 --> 01:56:54.863
and what did i get?

01:56:55.063 --> 01:56:57.779
- Why didn't they come?
- Just calm down.

01:57:03.604 --> 01:57:05.598
Damn it...

01:57:09.586 --> 01:57:11.586
Can I have it too?

01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:20.579
I think so...

01:57:20.603 --> 01:57:23.599
...that you will need a uniform.

01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:58.599
- Many people come from the city.
- We need more space.

01:57:59.598 --> 01:58:06.023
You are visitors. It is incredible
what you can achieve with anything.

01:58:31.583 --> 01:58:32.597
The princess!

01:59:05.606 --> 01:59:08.564
It succeeded!

01:59:08.588 --> 01:59:11.586
Long live the Black Panther!

01:59:28.604 --> 01:59:32.599
Namor believes
that Wakanda is weak.

01:59:33.604 --> 01:59:36.589
He murdered our Queen...

01:59:37.603 --> 01:59:40.603
...And destroyed the capital.

01:59:41.583 --> 01:59:44.580
He thinks we are vulnerable.

01:59:44.604 --> 01:59:49.577
...but now it is
time to attack

01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:53.604
How; We don't even know
how to find him?

01:59:54.584 --> 01:59:57.583
- We will bring Namor to us.
- Here again?

01:59:57.621 --> 02:00:00.618
No, in a remote location.

02:00:00.818 --> 02:00:03.784
Well.
Let's say it succeeds.

02:00:06.284 --> 02:00:10.919
Who can fly and can
to be as strong as the Hulk.

02:00:13.584 --> 02:00:16.104
...the right thing is to kill him?

02:00:16.304 --> 02:00:20.572
We call for his death, when
his only crime was bullying.

02:00:20.596 --> 02:00:22.569
What has changed, Lord Embaco?

02:00:22.593 --> 02:00:26.401
His soldiers
they didn't call him General or King,

02:00:26.562 --> 02:00:28.632
he was called Ku-kul-kan.

02:00:28.832 --> 02:00:31.605
- What it means;
- "Winged Serpent Deity".

02:00:32.585 --> 02:00:37.578
He believes that because we live in the mountains,
can't we read, books?

02:00:37.602 --> 02:00:41.569
Elders, with your permission.

02:00:41.593 --> 02:00:45.887
Would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku in private.

02:00:47.203 --> 02:00:47.783
Okay.

02:00:48.277 --> 02:00:48.855
Okay.

02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:57.469
Namor isn't done yet.

02:00:59.012 --> 02:01:01.845
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:04.366
Now is our chance
to defeat him.

02:01:04.525 --> 02:01:06.394
- What are you afraid of;
- The war.

02:01:06.594 --> 02:01:09.579
If they see Namor
truly as God...

02:01:09.603 --> 02:01:13.242
if we kill him,
we are in danger of perpetual war.

02:01:13.442 --> 02:01:16.581
So what; Life wasn't worth living
my mother's perpetual war?

02:01:16.605 --> 02:01:23.590
It's definitely worth it.

02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:29.138
But that's not it
that he would like for you.

02:01:33.606 --> 02:01:37.585
And that's not what I want...

02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:40.598
...for my people.

02:01:50.588 --> 02:01:53.585
You're talking about my mother
as if he is still with us.

02:01:54.594 --> 02:02:00.592
You talk about what she would want for me.
For hopes and dreams...

02:02:02.604 --> 02:02:06.604
but she is dead.
Passed away!

02:02:08.586 --> 02:02:11.605
Namor choked her in front of me.

02:02:13.593 --> 02:02:18.602
So her dreams, her goals,
and her hopes...

02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:23.602
...they don't exist.

02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:27.601
It doesn't matter anymore.

02:02:28.603 --> 02:02:32.421
What matters is what I want,

02:02:32.621 --> 02:02:35.588
and what I want is Namor dead.

02:02:38.598 --> 02:02:41.587
And you will help me defeat him.

02:02:47.601 --> 02:02:49.585
Understood?

02:02:56.596 --> 02:02:59.584
We are leaving tomorrow morning.

02:03:24.379 --> 02:03:26.393
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:03:28.392 --> 02:03:30.882
If we survive this,

02:03:31.391 --> 02:03:35.114
Know you have one
home with me in Haiti.

02:03:37.396 --> 02:03:40.394
hold my hand

02:03:43.387 --> 02:03:45.391
Breathe.

02:03:48.396 --> 02:03:54.387
Suri, be honest with me.
Who did you see when you took the herb?

02:03:59.393 --> 02:04:04.710
If you go to war for revenge, you won't
fill the void you feel from the loss.

02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:08.376
It will only grow
and it will consume you.

02:04:10.384 --> 02:04:12.380
He already has.

02:04:17.973 --> 02:04:24.947
Ku-kul-kan, a new machine
detects for vibranium in the ocean.

02:04:25.105 --> 02:04:26.079
Where;

02:04:27.387 --> 02:04:31.008 line:50%
ATLANTIC OCEAN

02:04:55.377 --> 02:04:56.393
Get out of the water!

02:05:40.395 --> 02:05:42.381
For the Queen.

02:06:56.383 --> 02:06:58.366
riri how are you

02:06:58.390 --> 02:07:03.385
- Griot, can you send help?
- You finally asked me.

02:07:14.396 --> 02:07:18.396
Come on, he's fast.
But I'm faster.

02:07:37.397 --> 02:07:39.397
I got you.

02:07:45.383 --> 02:07:47.259
It's up to you, Suri!

02:07:56.181 --> 02:07:57.780
- Princess.
- No.

02:07:58.367 --> 02:08:01.716
I am the Black Panther
and I came to take revenge.

02:08:01.916 --> 02:08:05.381
The cells were activated.

02:08:14.379 --> 02:08:17.381
What happened to you;
Would you like a glass of water?

02:08:21.383 --> 02:08:24.880
- We have it!
- Namor has been arrested.

02:08:25.347 --> 02:08:26.110
We're coming back.

02:08:30.388 --> 02:08:33.386
Back to Wakanda!

02:08:37.385 --> 02:08:38.391
We're leaving!

02:09:03.389 --> 02:09:08.183
- What happens;
- They destroyed the sonic cannon..

02:09:29.388 --> 02:09:31.382
This is not a good sign.

02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:08.223
The ship lost its energy
and we have significant losses.

02:10:08.423 --> 02:10:11.392
- Okay!
- Panther.

02:10:12.396 --> 02:10:17.388
The virus!
The time has come.

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:31.384
For Wakanda!

02:10:39.392 --> 02:10:42.364
- Griot, damage report.
- Destructive.

02:10:42.570 --> 02:10:44.523
His spear is crafted
from crude vibranium.

02:10:44.723 --> 02:10:46.843
- The ship will explode.
- Take us to the desert.

02:11:05.381 --> 02:11:06.386
No!

02:11:34.395 --> 02:11:36.382
Sink the ship!

02:12:03.393 --> 02:12:06.387
I'm holding you, sister.

02:13:10.383 --> 02:13:12.110
Warrior!

02:13:15.378 --> 02:13:17.782
You speak the mother tongue.

02:13:17.982 --> 02:13:20.791
You can use it
to greet your ancestors.

02:13:50.379 --> 02:13:51.586
Get off me!

02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:04.390
Well, come here.

02:14:08.408 --> 02:14:11.585
You will pay tribute
to your ancestors.

02:14:35.375 --> 02:14:38.370
Our ancestors will save us
if the princess doesn't hurry.

02:14:38.394 --> 02:14:41.134
We might go find them.

02:14:42.049 --> 02:14:44.394
Then let us take with us as many as we can.

02:15:14.398 --> 02:15:17.395
It could have been different.

02:15:20.398 --> 02:15:22.826
I need water.

02:15:39.377 --> 02:15:43.398
Will you be noble like your brother?
Or will you do what needs to be done...

02:15:43.646 --> 02:15:44.598
...like me;

02:15:44.798 --> 02:15:46.210
I'm not like my brother

02:15:47.379 --> 02:15:49.234
Namor will beg for mercy...

02:15:50.393 --> 02:15:52.554
while I will be by his side
and I will watch him die.

02:16:31.385 --> 02:16:34.401
King of the Empire

02:16:36.624 --> 02:16:37.673
Wakanda Forever!

02:18:26.376 --> 02:18:28.310
Suri.

02:18:29.377 --> 02:18:30.559
Mother...

02:18:32.392 --> 02:18:36.309
Show him who you are.

02:18:43.377 --> 02:18:45.358
Surrender,

02:18:45.382 --> 02:18:50.044
and Wakanda will protect
your seas and your secret.

02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:52.362
Surrender,

02:18:52.386 --> 02:18:54.336
and your people will live.

02:18:58.381 --> 02:19:03.691
We were thirsty for revenge.
We will not allow it to be conquered.

02:19:12.386 --> 02:19:14.378
Ι surrender.

02:19:39.379 --> 02:19:41.893
Tulscans!

02:19:43.379 --> 02:19:45.228
Let's go home.

02:19:45.428 --> 02:19:46.807
Our battle is over here.

02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:01.395
Wakanda Forever!

02:20:02.375 --> 02:20:04.379
Wakanda Forever!

02:20:47.965 --> 02:20:49.970
Thank you my love.

02:21:18.964 --> 02:21:22.943
- Ready to go home?
- Only the police are waiting for me.

02:21:22.967 --> 02:21:27.951
Do not worry.
But I won't help you with your lessons.

02:21:27.975 --> 02:21:30.619
If you get caught, I can't help you.

02:21:31.968 --> 02:21:34.952
- Did they say you wanted to talk to me?
- Yes.

02:21:34.976 --> 02:21:40.882
Your outfit. It has a nice design, though
I can't let you take her.

02:21:41.086 --> 02:21:45.946
Correctly. I think it is the least
that I could do.

02:21:45.970 --> 02:21:48.966
I want to show you one last thing.

02:21:52.968 --> 02:21:57.438
It took me a while to find
all the pieces in the river but it was worth it.

02:21:57.975 --> 02:21:59.943
How...;

02:21:59.967 --> 02:22:05.967
It's my father's car.
We were working on it before he died.

02:22:10.970 --> 02:22:14.900
- Are you sure;
- Yes, I will send you to Boston.

02:22:15.297 --> 02:22:16.467
and it will be there before you arrive.

02:22:21.959 --> 02:22:23.544
Come here.

02:22:25.972 --> 02:22:29.957
Panther, the transporter
for Miss Williams, arrived.

02:22:29.981 --> 02:22:32.610
Take care of yourself.

02:22:32.961 --> 02:22:37.498
Are you sure you won't come?
to see the Bulls in Chicago?

02:22:38.553 --> 02:22:41.974
Sounds nice, but
I have something to take care of.

02:23:06.969 --> 02:23:11.422
Now I present to you
Princess Suri.

02:23:11.622 --> 02:23:12.738
The Black Panther!

02:23:30.962 --> 02:23:33.683
Black Panther sends greetings...

02:23:35.229 --> 02:23:36.878
But he won't be with us today...

02:23:37.078 --> 02:23:38.979
I Em' Baku,

02:23:39.959 --> 02:23:44.951
Chieftain of the Jabari clan
and son of Wakanda...

02:23:44.975 --> 02:23:48.978
I would like to participate
in the challenge for the throne...

02:23:54.967 --> 02:23:56.915
What's going on, son?

02:23:58.933 --> 02:24:01.957
All my life I wanted

02:24:01.981 --> 02:24:05.870
to fight with you

02:24:06.963 --> 02:24:11.948
but I think you have submitted
to the Wakandans.

02:24:12.248 --> 02:24:17.191
Black Panther had a lot
good reason to kill me...

02:24:17.663 --> 02:24:20.857
Why do you think he didn't?

02:24:23.159 --> 02:24:27.216
The Black Panther
he is the strongest man

02:24:27.616 --> 02:24:33.399
to the most powerful nation on the surface

02:24:33.699 --> 02:24:36.678
But he has no allies.

02:24:36.978 --> 02:24:41.962
And now he has the sympathy
from the people of Talocan.

02:24:42.972 --> 02:24:45.583
With this alliance...

02:24:46.681 --> 02:24:53.446
The Talokan will be stronger than ever.

02:24:53.958 --> 02:24:57.953
the surface world
will attack Wakanda

02:24:58.549 --> 02:25:01.559
and Wakanda
will ask for our help.

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.322
Trust me!

02:25:20.968 --> 02:25:23.962
- What the hell is this;
- Can't we go back?

02:25:24.974 --> 02:25:30.098
- I do not know man. We'll lose an hour.
- Go see.

02:25:33.973 --> 02:25:35.552
I will save us.

02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:39.965
A tree blocks the road.
What do you want me to do;

02:25:52.976 --> 02:25:55.743
I like you in chains.

02:25:56.859 --> 02:25:58.657
When have I never seen you like this?

02:25:58.958 --> 02:26:00.974
- Very funny.
- Get out!

02:26:24.804 --> 02:26:25.447
Thanks.

02:26:28.827 --> 02:26:30.336
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

02:26:35.179 --> 02:26:36.746
- Hello.
- Good morning.

02:26:37.943 --> 02:26:39.432
Welcome!

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:42.664
I am glad to see you.

02:26:43.731 --> 02:26:46.065
Everything is ready.
Just give me a moment.

02:26:46.265 --> 02:26:49.457
In fact, I think everything should
to do it myself

02:26:49.981 --> 02:26:51.920
Of course.

BLACK PANTHER
WAKANTA FOREVER

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:28.044
Shuri...

02:31:29.631 --> 02:31:30.864
Can we sit with you?

02:31:34.564 --> 02:31:37.066
This is my son, Toussaint.

02:31:37.974 --> 02:31:42.825
Toussaint, this is your aunt, Suri.

02:31:44.449 --> 02:31:45.443
Hello.

02:32:06.885 --> 02:32:09.180
We had said it would be better
to grow up here.

02:32:09.722 --> 02:32:12.098
Away from the pressure of the throne.

02:32:14.505 --> 02:32:19.833
Your father, he prepared us
for his death, right?

02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:30.347
But he didn't want us to come to the funeral.
He felt the time was not right.

02:32:31.423 --> 02:32:33.959
So we did
our own ceremony for him.

02:32:36.221 --> 02:32:38.729
- Did my mom meet him?
- Of course he met him.

02:32:47.963 --> 02:32:50.446
- Nice to meet you.
- Also.

02:32:50.646 --> 02:32:54.728
Toussaint is a nice name.
It has a rich history.

02:32:54.963 --> 02:32:58.395
Thanks.
You are very good too. I think so;

02:33:02.236 --> 02:33:05.126
My mom said you're good
in keeping secrets. Is true;

02:33:06.364 --> 02:33:08.278
Yes, I can keep a secret.

02:33:12.225 --> 02:33:14.047
Toussaint is my name in Haitian.

02:33:16.966 --> 02:33:18.345
Who you are;

02:33:19.384 --> 02:33:23.426
I am Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.

02:33:26.835 --> 02:33:32.137
