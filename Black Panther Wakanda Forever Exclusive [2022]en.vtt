00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.673
Goddess Bast, time is running out.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.183
Help me heal my brother.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:13.374
And I won't doubt it
your existence again.

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.664
- His pulse dropped.
- The sequence is almost over.

00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:21.666
- Grio, give me control.
- As you wish, Princess.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.653
- What is the success rate?
- At 25%.

00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:31.654
I have to try something else.

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:35.646
King Chala's heartbeat
decreased to 31 beats per minute.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.654
- Princess, you must go next to him.
- I have to think. Get out.

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:43.678
Get out!

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.658
- What is the success rate?
- At 29.1%.

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:53.671
Print it!

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.653
I know it's urgent, but I have to
to warn you

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:05.663
This synthetic heart is nothing like it
to have the desired effect.

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:09.681
I do not care!
It should work.

00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.648
- Gray...
- Yes, princess?

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.674
What is my brother's heart rate?

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:42.681
Your brother is with the ancestors.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:51.676
No...

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:59.652
Thanks for the gift.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.648
By King Anda Raja T'Challa.

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:07.139
Of the Black Panther.

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.807
His son Putra Raja T'Chaka.

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.266
My son.

00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:20.075
Descendants of the great King Basenga,

00:03:20.153 --> 00:03:22.925
Of the first Black Panther.

00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:27.671
He left us and went away.
We honor the ancestors.

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:51.323
I'll miss you...

UN, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:36.656
It is an honor for me to invite
Your Majesty Queen Ramon,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.666
Princess Lumumba,
and the Queen of Wakanda.

00:07:53.684 --> 00:07:56.649
Sir, Secretary.

00:07:56.673 --> 00:08:01.665
I want to speak for everyone
of the Member States when I say,

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:06.185
that I am deeply disappointed
since the failure of Wakanda

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.205
to live up to their promises,

00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:12.657
to become a global player,
to overcome international challenges,

00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:18.647
to share resources and collaborate
fully for vibranium.

00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:21.647
France has said,

00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:23.413
that vibranium
can be used

00:08:23.513 --> 00:08:26.063
for weapons production
mass destruction.

00:08:26.263 --> 00:08:30.657
The substance does not activate
the metal detectors.

00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:35.665
This is a safety hazard
and the non-proliferation treaty.

00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:39.673
I give the floor to Queen Ramon.

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:51.653
Our policy has always been not to
we ever deal with vibranium

00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:54.654
under any circumstances.

00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:59.655
Not because of potential
dangers of vibranium,

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:04.673
but at your own risk.

00:09:06.689 --> 00:09:09.682 line:50%
FOUR FAMILIES
WAKANDA ANSOGOU, MALI

00:09:16.673 --> 00:09:18.325
The image on the monitor went black.

00:09:22.672 --> 00:09:26.111
Calm down!
Fall to the floor!

00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:29.378
Where is the vibranium?

00:09:33.668 --> 00:09:35.681
Who has access to it?

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:49.657
Pretend to be polite.

00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:54.650
But we know why you're talking
inside government buildings

00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:57.688
and in military installations.

00:10:01.675 --> 00:10:04.668
"The king is dead."

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.686
Black Panther is gone.

00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:14.666
They lost their patron.

00:10:19.687 --> 00:10:23.681
Now we have the opportunity to...

00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:25.685
"...we attack."

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:57.670
- Varius, where is your spear?
- Suri gave me these.

00:10:59.672 --> 00:11:01.646
I prefer them.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.678
Our ancestors gave us the spears.

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:09.676
... on and off.

00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:14.475
Nothing changes under my watch.

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.193
Yes, General.

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.682
I said don't take them.

00:11:22.674 --> 00:11:27.491
Last night an installation of ours
was attacked.

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:31.660
I can prove that the UN
is behind it

00:11:31.684 --> 00:11:36.573
as it downloads to your phone.

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:40.546
And as for the identity of the culprit...

00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:53.689
Kneel down!

00:11:57.681 --> 00:11:59.619
Here is.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:06.676
Consider the answer to this
the attack as a friendly gesture.

00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:13.664
Further attempts to steal our resources
will be considered an attack

00:12:13.688 --> 00:12:19.651
and will cause
a stronger reaction from us.

00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:25.650
We mourn our king.
But don't believe at all,

00:12:25.674 --> 00:12:31.119
that Wakanda has lost the ability
to protect its resources.

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:35.324
We know your efforts
which are under development

00:12:35.524 --> 00:12:37.734
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda.

00:12:37.934 --> 00:12:43.058
And I wish you good luck.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:50.671
Atlantic ocean
Rotor 625 requested clearance to land.

00:12:54.677 --> 00:12:56.684
See you inside.

00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:04.195
- Didn't you retire?
- I thought so too.

00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:07.897
The odds of finding vibranium
they should be very few.

00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:09.039
I think so too.

00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:35.689
Cabin pressure good.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.647
240 meters.

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:46.710
- Move to the next layer.
- All systems OK.

00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:49.670
Received.

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.253
We have reached the bottom.

00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:11.526
Great then, Salazar, you're close.

00:14:12.678 --> 00:14:15.008
This is awesome.

00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:19.928
The drill seems to have
hit something like metal.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.356
At least it's stable.

00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:25.624
I've never seen a drill before
to be so shattered.

00:14:28.677 --> 00:14:32.373
Amen, man.
Vibran in the ocean.

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:36.293
Let's get rid of the tracker.
It's all we have.

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:39.624
We are heading
in the vibranium detector.

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:54.804
- Everything went dark.
- Power supply stopped.

00:14:55.303 --> 00:14:56.756
I'll take care of it from now on.

00:15:12.672 --> 00:15:14.679
What the hell was that?

00:15:27.669 --> 00:15:30.759
Jackson, did you see that too?

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:33.104
Salazar's beats.

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:35.290
Salazar, can you take a picture?

00:15:36.683 --> 00:15:40.945
A jellyfish.
I have never seen such a color before.

00:15:41.992 --> 00:15:43.715
Rescue Squad, alert.

00:15:43.853 --> 00:15:47.345
Salazar, Jackson's Vital Organs
they do not work. You see him;

00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:59.243
- No, he left.
- What do you mean, he left?

00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:04.667
Salazar, can you hear me?
Salazar?

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:06.686
NO SIGNAL

00:16:08.666 --> 00:16:11.060
Smith, something is wrong.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.999
- What sound is that?
- Where is that sound coming from?

00:16:33.017 --> 00:16:34.789
From the west, finally?

00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:38.582
West, do you see anything?

00:16:58.096 --> 00:17:01.459
- It's a sonic attack.
- Wear earplugs.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.326
We are under attack.
Send in a strike team.

00:17:11.724 --> 00:17:15.094
Help, help. 625 rotors here.

00:17:15.263 --> 00:17:16.565
Send help immediately.

00:17:16.688 --> 00:17:17.610
He's from Wakanda.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.951
Of course.

00:17:36.672 --> 00:17:37.817
Henderson!

00:17:38.017 --> 00:17:39.169
We have to get out of here.

00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:40.369
Henderson!

00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:42.681
Come!

00:17:44.687 --> 00:17:47.681
- What happens;
- Get down from there.

00:18:04.675 --> 00:18:05.675
Chase her!

00:18:25.684 --> 00:18:27.682
Throw, Throw, Throw!

00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:37.681
Fly, get rid of them!

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.089
- They leave.
- Oh my god...

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:04.687
- Take us away.
- We are OK.

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.259
Where's the strike team?

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.599
The code is blue.
Everyone is dead.

00:19:13.626 --> 00:19:15.517
- What happened;
- They're pulling us back!

00:19:23.677 --> 00:19:25.676
Wait!

00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:04.733
The Queen of Wakanda gave yesterday
a strong speech at the United Nations,

00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:09.456
while the captured mercenaries
were brought before the Assembly.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:13.406
The Queen is restored
as regent of Wakanda,

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:16.937
when King Chala died
last year from an unknown illness.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.651
This small nation is preparing for battle
and is increasingly isolated.

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:26.133
Highness...
We are approaching the border.

00:20:32.267 --> 00:20:34.260
We returned home.

00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:27.907
- Princess...
- Wait a minute, I'm doing something.

00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:31.369
- I know, but...
- You're interrupting my thoughts.

00:21:34.265 --> 00:21:37.077
- Suri.
- Mother.

00:21:37.277 --> 00:21:40.459
I wanted to tell you that the queen has arrived.

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:41.391
Thanks.

00:21:41.469 --> 00:21:46.684
You make me nervous. One day the artificial
intelligence will kill us all.

00:21:46.884 --> 00:21:49.075
Artificial intelligence
it's not like in the movies.

00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:51.548
It's exactly what I tell him to do.

00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:54.563
I wish all kids were like that.

00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:57.923
Everyone seems to be working hard.

00:21:58.212 --> 00:22:01.921
This is the emergency team.

00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:07.123
There can be many threats
out there and we find the solutions.

00:22:09.236 --> 00:22:12.004
- What is this;
- Uniforms for soldiers.

00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:16.890
It provides the user with increased
strength, speed and endurance.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.236
But like everything they don't like it.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.382
- Which one;
- He hates them.

00:22:27.264 --> 00:22:30.169
What about creating a heart?

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:32.384
Have you ever thought
that he would not approve?

00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:35.321
sorry princess
Nakia, Princess of Yaa,

00:22:35.388 --> 00:22:36.758
is trying to find you again.

00:22:37.352 --> 00:22:39.650
- Maybe I should...
- Be careful with the calculations

00:22:39.893 --> 00:22:41.147
and don't distract me.

00:22:41.347 --> 00:22:42.584
As you wish princess.

00:22:43.273 --> 00:22:48.708
We don't need the filter.
We need new technology.

00:22:48.878 --> 00:22:50.212
What will happen to black panther?

00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:57.073
This title has stuck with the nation for centuries.

00:22:57.271 --> 00:22:59.205
Black Panther is a thing of the past.

00:22:59.428 --> 00:23:01.462
I wasn't trying to save the title.

00:23:01.604 --> 00:23:03.597
I was trying to save my brother.

00:23:05.264 --> 00:23:07.217
Shuri...

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:24.273
- What day is today;
- Tuesday.

00:23:25.253 --> 00:23:27.270
Date, son.

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:36.424
- My brother died.
- It was a year ago.

00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:51.245
- Have you planned anything?
- Yes. We must be together.

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:53.248
- Now?
- Yes.

00:23:54.074 --> 00:23:56.106
Just leave the chemotherapy pearls.

00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:58.736
You won't need them where we're going.

00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:04.889
Also the other two.

00:24:30.254 --> 00:24:33.936
Sit here with me and alone.

00:24:34.643 --> 00:24:36.820
It's the only way for them to heal

00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:39.283
the wounds after T'Challa's death.

00:24:39.483 --> 00:24:40.578
I'm fine, mother.

00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:43.934
Do not worry about me.

00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:48.916
He left, but I moved on.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.611
Chala is dead,
but it doesn't mean it's gone.

00:24:54.703 --> 00:24:56.273
When the disease killed
your brother

00:24:57.253 --> 00:25:01.373
I had to lead a nation
wounded in a world in crisis.

00:25:02.002 --> 00:25:04.347
But I still went to the bushes.

00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:07.960
I wandered until I found water,

00:25:08.252 --> 00:25:10.272
and then I sat down.

00:25:11.252 --> 00:25:15.635
So I did the ritual
which I will show you now.

00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:23.235
I found your brother in the breeze.

00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:27.244
He pushed me gently but firmly,

00:25:27.268 --> 00:25:31.248
whose hand was on my shoulder.

00:25:31.272 --> 00:25:34.273
It's been a while,

00:25:35.253 --> 00:25:38.257
but it was there.

00:25:43.257 --> 00:25:46.238
He wasn't there, mother.

00:25:46.262 --> 00:25:50.291
The presence you felt
it is an illusion of the mind

00:25:52.681 --> 00:25:55.421
to entertain you
or to please you.

00:25:56.261 --> 00:25:57.273
Only that.

00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:10.247
What feeling do you feel?
when you think of your brother?

00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:13.273
It brings you comfort...

00:26:14.253 --> 00:26:15.273
...or sadness?

00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:31.262
Come on, my child.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:45.231
- Where did you find this;
- Does not matter;

00:26:45.255 --> 00:26:48.230
What do they have to do with ritual?

00:26:48.254 --> 00:26:53.291
We burn the funeral clothes to
end the mourning period

00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:58.973
and start new relationships
leaving our loved ones.

00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:00.626
I don't know, mom.

00:27:01.268 --> 00:27:07.234
If I sit I will think
my brother for a long time...

00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:09.966
... not the clothes I burned.

00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:15.269
The whole world does that.

00:27:17.252 --> 00:27:18.268
Shuri...

00:27:22.923 --> 00:27:27.610
Suri, there's something you have to do
to tell you about your brother.

00:27:31.272 --> 00:27:34.270
Mother, wait.
What are you doing;

00:28:00.255 --> 00:28:03.478
- Is it part of the ceremony?
- No it is not.

00:28:05.254 --> 00:28:06.944
Keep still!

00:28:07.567 --> 00:28:10.550
Who are you and how did you get in here?

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.619
This place is perfect.

00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:16.342
The air is still pristine.

00:28:17.261 --> 00:28:19.014
And the water...

00:28:20.256 --> 00:28:22.748
My mom told me about it.

00:28:23.027 --> 00:28:25.657
protected country,
where people never leave

00:28:25.857 --> 00:28:29.391
or change their lifestyle.

00:28:30.452 --> 00:28:33.088
What reason did you have to reveal?
this secret in the world?

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.945
I don't like repeating myself.

00:28:36.699 --> 00:28:38.625
Who you are;

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.942
I have many names.

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:43.510
My folks call me Kukulan.

00:28:46.253 --> 00:28:48.128
My enemies call me Namor.

00:28:49.265 --> 00:28:54.364
The US military found vibranium
under my own Royal rule.

00:28:54.688 --> 00:28:58.685
I could stop the export,

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.082
but we needed
the help of wakanda,

00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:02.654
so that it doesn't happen again.

00:29:04.078 --> 00:29:06.641
They have a machine developed
by a scientist.

00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:10.471
Vibranium is only found here.

00:29:10.671 --> 00:29:12.839
Mom, he's covered in it.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.970
Your son revealed
the power of vibranium, in the world.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.647
It had caused other countries to terminate
this planet after that.

00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:28.058
His choice put us in danger.

00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:32.365
I think you can find some
researchers and bring them to me.

00:29:33.504 --> 00:29:37.378
It's only natural that Wakanda should help
in solving our dilemma.

00:29:37.471 --> 00:29:42.485
You are sneaking into my country
and you tell me what is fair.

00:29:44.289 --> 00:29:47.255
My army is so
as numerous as blades of grass

00:29:48.524 --> 00:29:51.196
and their power is incomparable.

00:29:51.376 --> 00:29:54.298
I would not return under any other circumstances.

00:30:00.254 --> 00:30:03.254
When you find the researchers, burn them.

00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:06.992
Then I'll be there in no time.

00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:11.618
For your own sake,

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:15.919
please don't say my name
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

00:30:24.258 --> 00:30:27.266
Did you see the feathers on his ankles?

00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:44.228
How did he do it?

00:30:44.428 --> 00:30:46.766
We must convene the Council.

00:30:48.252 --> 00:30:51.934
Heaven Scrapers has not
recorded activity.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.752
Was the river border breached?

00:30:59.188 --> 00:31:00.860
I wish my soldiers were there,

00:31:01.341 --> 00:31:05.129
this fisherman would already be in front of you.

00:31:05.282 --> 00:31:10.732
If your army was there,
they would still lie there dazed.

00:31:10.873 --> 00:31:14.012
- You are a bald devil.
- Show each other respect.

00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:14.920
Respect?

00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:18.923
- These people should be ashamed.
- Watch how you speak, Jabari.

00:31:32.442 --> 00:31:36.964
As I said, he didn't show up
on some surveillance camera.

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:42.102
- Not even on the radar.
- Did he swim 100 kilometers?

00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:45.914
And he claims to lead a large army.

00:31:46.114 --> 00:31:51.437
He wants us to catch an investigator
American to kill him?

00:31:51.637 --> 00:31:52.610
Do it.

00:31:54.263 --> 00:31:58.402
We never had an enemy that had vibranium

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:01.737
and we don't have Black Panther
to protect us.

00:32:01.877 --> 00:32:05.254
Why did you let Kilman take the throne?

00:32:06.006 --> 00:32:08.070
and burn all heart-shaped potions.

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:13.271
- Baku, what do you want us to do?
- Find the fisherman and kill him.

00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:17.141
If we do what he asks now,

00:32:17.341 --> 00:32:21.943
what will prevent him from coming
and demand more?

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:33.249
Sit down.

00:32:33.273 --> 00:32:39.971
- Is it my idea or is it ugly?
- It's your idea.

00:32:40.171 --> 00:32:41.976
It works;

00:32:42.176 --> 00:32:46.423
Yes, the machine can
to detect vibranium

00:32:46.542 --> 00:32:49.628
through water, rocks
and heavy metals.

00:32:49.828 --> 00:32:51.594
Whoever did this
he is an excellent inventor.

00:32:51.986 --> 00:32:52.918
Come and see.

00:32:54.078 --> 00:32:56.606
Some pieces are manufactured
By order,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.530
while others look like something out of a mantra.

00:32:58.824 --> 00:33:03.708
I still find it hard to believe
that there is vibranium outside of Wukanda.

00:33:03.866 --> 00:33:06.051
There may have been two meteorites.

00:33:06.258 --> 00:33:08.317
The planet is covered mostly by water,

00:33:08.369 --> 00:33:11.662
so of course the others
to end up there.

00:33:11.837 --> 00:33:16.544
- This changes everything we know.
- The mountains, all the myths...

00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:21.944
- They are etched in my mind.
- That sounds painful.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.677
Then we have to find
this researcher.

00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:29.132
I have an idea.

00:33:30.517 --> 00:33:33.547
- I'll need the princess.
- Don't subject her to this.

00:33:34.151 --> 00:33:37.249
- She's not ready at all.
- Your Highness...

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:41.044
It would do her good to get out a little.

00:33:41.668 --> 00:33:44.552
Maybe he needs it.

00:33:44.963 --> 00:33:48.899
And I can handle
blindfolded Americans.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.536
They are not the ones that worry me.

00:33:52.252 --> 00:33:56.260
He got past our defenses.

00:33:56.412 --> 00:34:00.068
- It will not happen again.
- He's not alone.

00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:02.270
He wants to be with me.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:08.316
When are we going to visit?
my favorite colonist?

00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:13.870 line:50%
ALEXANDRIA
VIRGINIA

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.304
Come on...

00:34:40.256 --> 00:34:43.684
Yes, I'm in.
I follow.

00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:47.372
Slower.

00:34:54.251 --> 00:34:57.639
- You couldn't call?
- I didn't know your number?

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:01.528
We are looking for the scientist

00:35:01.728 --> 00:35:03.515
who discovered the vibranium detector.

00:35:03.715 --> 00:35:05.230
Then you were in the Atlantic.

00:35:07.013 --> 00:35:08.841
Ship drilling, many dead...

00:35:10.338 --> 00:35:11.835
- What happened;
- Seriously?

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:16.823
It was us and the frogmen.

00:35:17.023 --> 00:35:19.821
30 of the best
and two officers.

00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:23.552
My personal friend, he died in one hit.

00:35:24.615 --> 00:35:29.108
- They were looking for vibranium...
- Wakanda is not behind this.

00:35:29.308 --> 00:35:30.900
Then who was it?

00:35:33.016 --> 00:35:34.839
For this to work...

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.098
When I give you information,
you have to give me something too.

00:35:37.244 --> 00:35:39.191
We can't tell you that.

00:35:39.821 --> 00:35:43.526
We need to communicate
with the investigators before it is too late.

00:35:43.726 --> 00:35:47.241
You owe me this, Ross.
You owe it to my brother.

00:35:51.258 --> 00:35:52.273
Okay, listen.

00:35:53.253 --> 00:35:57.433
An agent was sentenced to death
with less than I will tell you now.

00:35:58.032 --> 00:36:01.281
And our new boss is like a hawk.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.073
We have to be very careful.

00:36:04.273 --> 00:36:06.646
You also need to be careful
and be quick.

00:36:06.887 --> 00:36:08.236
USA needs new engines,

00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:10.792
and the girl is the only one
to the world that can make it.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.068
- And they will chase it.
- Girl?

00:36:15.872 --> 00:36:20.018
CAMBRIDGE
MASSACHUSETTS

00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:26.930
- You forgot to transfer money.
- Yes.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.960
- It's 800, right?
- That was yesterday.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.183
- Now it's interest.
- This is robbery.

00:36:34.747 --> 00:36:38.529
I made my own robot arm.
I just fixed the algorithm.

00:36:39.255 --> 00:36:41.269
And how much will it cost?

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:47.268
Thanks

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.242
- Is this an iPhone?
- Primitive.

00:36:54.266 --> 00:36:58.566
Your Highness, we found the investigator...
343
00:35:59,130 ​​--&gt; 00:36:02,492
partner for Wakanda schools.

00:37:03.824 --> 00:37:06.396
I hope he is a professor.

00:37:06.596 --> 00:37:08.193
She is a student, a mother.

00:37:08.554 --> 00:37:10.185
We can't give her to Namor.

00:37:10.385 --> 00:37:13.607
Bring her to Wakanda.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.778
Yes, Your Highness.

00:37:18.272 --> 00:37:22.622
- I'm in charge now.
- Let me talk to her.

00:37:22.992 --> 00:37:26.640
- It would be more subtle.
- I can be discreet.

00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:32.135
- What is;
- Nothing.

00:37:32.324 --> 00:37:33.317
- Is this makeup?
- Nice.

00:37:34.368 --> 00:37:39.235
- Is the shadow wrong?
- No, Fendi. You look fine.

00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:43.272
I can look like a student.
I can do it.

00:37:47.255 --> 00:37:48.492
You have five minutes.

00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:03.423
- Yes?
- Riri Williams?

00:38:06.267 --> 00:38:08.632
I don't accept visitors.

00:38:08.676 --> 00:38:10.160
You must visit
my website.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.598
This is an encrypted file.
I'll leave it here.

00:38:15.258 --> 00:38:17.258
Are you...

00:38:19.252 --> 00:38:21.043
You are Princess Suri.

00:38:22.256 --> 00:38:26.250
What are you doing here;
Will you recruit me?

00:38:27.262 --> 00:38:33.246
No. I came for the scout
of the vibranium you made for the Co.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:37.246
I didn't make it for the CIA,
but as a metallurgical mission.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:43.242
- Homework;
- The teacher said it was impossible.

00:38:43.266 --> 00:38:48.246
But we are young
talented and black.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.263
Maybe we don't say that in Wakanda.

00:38:53.258 --> 00:38:56.243
- How old are you;
- 19.

00:38:56.267 --> 00:39:00.910
A genius is not recognized
always by the elders.

00:39:02.258 --> 00:39:05.330
- How much will it take?
- Several months.

00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:06.530
Several months?

00:39:06.697 --> 00:39:09.428
The hardest part was
to find enough leaves.

00:39:10.258 --> 00:39:12.334
Is Wakanda mad at me?

00:39:12.602 --> 00:39:15.944
Not just us.
You're in danger here.

00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:18.985
Pack your things and come with me.

00:39:19.268 --> 00:39:23.136
I have calculus in a quarter of an hour...

00:39:25.253 --> 00:39:26.245
Okay.

00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:31.132
Okay, wait here.

00:39:31.332 --> 00:39:33.138
I want to go to the bathroom.

00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:42.837
- I had it under control.
- I said five minutes. Six passed.

00:39:43.108 --> 00:39:46.259
Get out of my room.
Get out!

00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:51.689
Don't come one step closer!

00:39:52.104 --> 00:39:54.613
You see how they teach children
to deal with the guests?

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.233
- Do you have a spear with you?
- You brought a spear.

00:40:03.257 --> 00:40:07.270
- I like.
- Put it down.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:11.245
- You're going to get hurt.
- Leave me, my daughter.

00:40:11.269 --> 00:40:17.233
Girl, I'm giving you two choices.

00:40:17.257 --> 00:40:21.678
You can come to Wakanda
alive or unconscious.

00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:28.180
You should take more care
your appearance, than your face.

00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:32.100
- Do you find it funny?
- No it is not.

00:40:32.703 --> 00:40:34.157
- I told you.
- You were fine.

00:40:34.357 --> 00:40:35.466
Let's go.

00:40:35.556 --> 00:40:38.878
Let's tell him to come
to fight alongside the mermaid

00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:43.771
with ankle feathers,
who wants to kill him, alone.

00:40:43.997 --> 00:40:45.394
You can do it easily.

00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:46.796
You and your heater.

00:40:48.253 --> 00:40:49.253
Here you go;

00:40:55.479 --> 00:40:58.445
Where are we;

00:40:58.469 --> 00:41:01.479
I built some cars for the boss.

00:41:02.815 --> 00:41:07.459
And it allows me to work.
I have to get my laptop.

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:15.283
- Please don't touch anything.
- Do not worry.

00:41:15.583 --> 00:41:19.504
It may not seem,
but it is my life's work.

00:41:19.704 --> 00:41:23.765
Well, the image on the screen
do you have it on your laptop too?

00:41:24.466 --> 00:41:27.256
And you've left it at that
open in the workshop?

00:41:27.471 --> 00:41:30.591
It is encrypted at 2065-bytes.

00:41:31.072 --> 00:41:32.058
Impressive.

00:41:32.258 --> 00:41:36.139
- Have you ever been locked out?
- Yes, a whole semester.

00:41:36.855 --> 00:41:40.558
I had to build a quantum computer
to crack my own encryption.

00:41:40.758 --> 00:41:42.027
What technology is this?

00:41:42.514 --> 00:41:44.708
- Is it Stark technology?
- I said don't touch anything.

00:41:44.974 --> 00:41:47.811
Princess, the police just arrived.

00:41:48.461 --> 00:41:50.872
- Who is this;
- My artificial intelligence.

00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:53.468
They surround us.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.716
You said a mermaid is chasing me.
These are Federalists.

00:42:14.475 --> 00:42:19.480
I don't need this.
I swear.

00:42:19.814 --> 00:42:22.620
This is not going to go very well.
I was very dumb.

00:42:22.925 --> 00:42:28.841
The Princess of Wakanda has arrived
at my door, then all was lost.

00:42:29.041 --> 00:42:32.755
I'm thinking of risking it, with the mermaid.

00:42:32.955 --> 00:42:36.292
At least he hasn't
nothing to do with the FBI.

00:42:38.336 --> 00:42:43.648
Namor sank a boat
of SIA because of your machine.

00:42:43.848 --> 00:42:47.691
So for them it is the least
that you should worry about.

00:42:47.891 --> 00:42:52.896
We have to work together to get out.
General, we are surrounded.

00:42:53.096 --> 00:42:55.480
- Maybe we should split up.
- This is not possible.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.448
- Do the vehicles work?
- No.

00:43:00.476 --> 00:43:03.481
Everything works,
like these machines.

00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:08.673
Forget it.
After all, there are three of us.

00:43:08.873 --> 00:43:11.739
There are two of you.
I'll take this.

00:43:12.468 --> 00:43:16.450
I knew the. Don't tell me
that you made it in two months?

00:43:16.474 --> 00:43:19.454
It took me ages with this one.

00:43:19.478 --> 00:43:24.151
- Have you ever thrown it away?
- It can fly;

00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:27.957
There are many channels on YouTube
that guide you how to fly.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.032
It's fantastic.

00:43:29.711 --> 00:43:33.328
We have an arrest warrant
for Riri Williams!

00:43:33.389 --> 00:43:36.288
We have a wireless device
so we will communicate.

00:43:36.446 --> 00:43:40.626
General Okoi and Princess Shuri,
go out with your hands up.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.634
- What scrap metal.
- Be careful with these.

00:43:45.463 --> 00:43:46.921
The key is on the chair.

00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:50.230
When we cross the bridge,
they won't be able to catch us.

00:43:50.406 --> 00:43:51.912
We have to separate.

00:43:52.437 --> 00:43:55.769
The laboratory is not our home.

00:43:55.906 --> 00:43:59.472
- Then get in the car.
- He always has to shout.

00:44:05.461 --> 00:44:08.505
We will break the door in three,

00:44:08.705 --> 00:44:11.300
two one.

00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:14.475
FBI!
Don't move.

00:44:15.468 --> 00:44:19.460
- What was that;
- He has an Iron Man suit!

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.136
Stay still!

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.635
- So it flies.
- Gray...

00:44:26.845 --> 00:44:28.191
- Yes, Princess.
- ...now!

00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:29.834
Remote control activated.

00:44:30.053 --> 00:44:30.650
Let's go!

00:44:43.464 --> 00:44:46.373
Grio, turn on the video.

00:44:54.464 --> 00:44:56.044
- Gray...
- Yes, General.

00:44:56.244 --> 00:44:57.997
Take me to the princess.

00:44:58.414 --> 00:45:01.233
Otherwise, I will nail
my spear to your editor

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:04.439
and you won't be able to edit
data for the next century.

00:45:04.604 --> 00:45:05.660
Give me some time, General.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.960
Okay, I'm coming to you.

00:45:17.914 --> 00:45:23.461
- Grio, leave the control to me, now!
- I just opened the way for you.

00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:31.681
You are in control General.
Manual control activated.

00:45:48.458 --> 00:45:51.459
- We have to find a hiding place.
- Let's cross the river.

00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:58.477
They have a block on the bridge.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.521
Princess, you are being watched by a drone.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.137
- At what height?
- Nine km.

00:46:14.472 --> 00:46:17.476
Wait, I'll arrange it.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:23.920
Think, a little Riri, because you have to solve

00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:27.369
the equation that is equal to
with the relative speed.

00:46:27.514 --> 00:46:30.632
Riri, you can't make it
the drone without an oxygen mask.

00:46:32.466 --> 00:46:35.443
Oxygen level: 55%.

00:46:35.643 --> 00:46:38.466
Eight and a half kilometers.

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:42.081
Oxygen level: 30%.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.478
Maximum acceleration. Regulation
Euler's point of view and I arrived.

00:46:56.468 --> 00:46:58.463
Oxygen level: 0%.

00:47:02.205 --> 00:47:04.003
The drone is no longer following you.

00:47:04.203 --> 00:47:07.113
Altitude:
At 500 km it drops.

00:47:07.313 --> 00:47:08.518
Rin, are you okay?

00:47:09.546 --> 00:47:10.386
Riri!

00:47:13.467 --> 00:47:14.694
I am fine.

00:47:17.554 --> 00:47:18.281
No.

00:47:19.049 --> 00:47:23.074
I have a special tradition
in three, two, one...

00:47:25.378 --> 00:47:26.248
Well done Riri!

00:47:34.478 --> 00:47:36.458
What happened to him;

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.468
What happened; Shuri! Shuri!

00:48:23.472 --> 00:48:26.073
The princess situation
is stable.

00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:28.743
She will regain consciousness soon.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.796
Take one more step
and I will kill you all.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:09.542
Put your gun down!

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.444
Kill the scientist.
I will take the witnesses.

00:49:15.468 --> 00:49:16.537
Understandable.

00:49:18.665 --> 00:49:19.316
It's blue;

00:49:21.201 --> 00:49:23.160
Kill the woman first.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.274
You don't want to mess with Namor.

00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:13.092
You are not worthy of my sword.

00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:27.170
Why are you late?

00:51:27.289 --> 00:51:29.898
We don't have time for bullshit.

00:51:38.478 --> 00:51:41.444
Perfect!

00:51:41.468 --> 00:51:43.479
- Wait!
- Enable translator.

00:51:44.459 --> 00:51:49.247
I am Shuri, Princess of Wakanda.
Take me to Namor.

00:51:49.447 --> 00:51:51.026
Don't bother the girl.

00:51:53.475 --> 00:51:55.481
"Should we capture them alive?"

00:51:56.478 --> 00:51:58.465
"Yes, Atuma."

00:52:14.474 --> 00:52:16.469
"Inhale."

00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:26.464
Shuri!

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:47.205
Ross, Co.
Witnesses;

00:52:47.405 --> 00:52:49.770
No, but we think so
that they are Wakandans.

00:52:50.476 --> 00:52:54.475
- Langley says they're coming.
- Who called you?

00:52:55.478 --> 00:52:57.461
She.

00:52:59.477 --> 00:53:02.611
- Director de Fontaine.
- Seriously?

00:53:04.462 --> 00:53:06.453
They think they are Wakandans.

00:53:06.477 --> 00:53:11.452
We monitor everything.
That's why I called you.

00:53:11.476 --> 00:53:16.444
You look fine.
Are you done with the gym?

00:53:16.468 --> 00:53:20.498
- Yes, last year.
- Then let me ride a bike.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.442
I am the agent in charge.

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:26.328
Well done. Would you mind
tell me what happened here?

00:53:26.754 --> 00:53:27.623
- Yes.
- Nice.

00:53:27.823 --> 00:53:30.327
Okay, so what happened.

00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:34.024
We thought it was a car accident,
but we could not find the car.

00:53:34.183 --> 00:53:36.861
- Was it like this when you came?
- Yes.

00:53:37.108 --> 00:53:41.457
We think someone took the car out
off the road and fell into the river.

00:53:41.481 --> 00:53:44.439
You can't be serious.

00:53:44.463 --> 00:53:48.446
To go to the laboratories immediately.
Send it to the NSA immediately.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:52.449
Ross, would you mind?
take me back to langley?

00:53:52.473 --> 00:53:56.714
- The trip is eight hours.
- We will talk about the case.

00:53:56.966 --> 00:53:58.453
I actually want too

00:53:58.477 --> 00:54:02.643
to apologize for some
things i said when we got married

00:54:05.469 --> 00:54:10.306
They are blue and have superpowers.

00:54:10.506 --> 00:54:14.441
They came out of the water above
on the backs of whales.

00:54:14.465 --> 00:54:19.443
I killed three of them,
But they got up again.

00:54:19.467 --> 00:54:23.281
I want to start right away
to search for the princess.

00:54:34.468 --> 00:54:35.479
Okay.

00:54:36.459 --> 00:54:40.452
You will be stripped of your position
leader of the Wakanda military

00:54:40.476 --> 00:54:44.462
and your status as a warrior.

00:54:48.462 --> 00:54:51.042
May I speak, Your Highness?

00:54:51.478 --> 00:54:52.971
Yes, you can talk.

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:55.468
I beg you...

00:54:56.478 --> 00:54:58.478
I have given everything.

00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:03.439
Let me die to save
my country and my throne.

00:55:03.463 --> 00:55:05.443
I am begging you.

00:55:05.467 --> 00:55:09.479
- Let me make amends.
- Make amends?

00:55:10.459 --> 00:55:13.445
I don't know if my daughter
is she alive or dead

00:55:13.469 --> 00:55:17.462
Perhaps we are too hasty.

00:55:18.477 --> 00:55:23.442
She raised her spear against
of her husband for the sake of Wakanda.

00:55:23.466 --> 00:55:29.440
And where is her husband now?
A place he can go.

00:55:29.464 --> 00:55:33.448
Mine is with the ancestors.

00:55:33.472 --> 00:55:38.447
I am the queen of more
powerful nation in the world,

00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:42.443
and i lost my whole family!

00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:45.476
Didn't I give everything?

00:55:54.471 --> 00:55:57.476
Get up, general.

00:56:02.473 --> 00:56:08.451
I stood up for you when
killmonger took the throne.

00:56:08.475 --> 00:56:12.447
But you and the board members
council together you supported him,

00:56:12.471 --> 00:56:17.441
when I ran to Jabari for protection.

00:56:17.465 --> 00:56:21.480
I warned you not to take it
my daughter on this mission,

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.452
and you lost her.

00:56:24.476 --> 00:56:28.470
So today you are done.

00:57:15.467 --> 00:57:17.478
Are you here, Grio?

00:57:19.464 --> 00:57:21.448
Yes, my Queen.

00:57:21.472 --> 00:57:24.480
Were you with Suri when she was kidnapped?

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:26.445
Yes I was.

00:57:26.469 --> 00:57:29.446
You can spot
the chemotherapy pearls?

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:32.410
We found bullets all over Cambridge.

00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:34.845
The people of Wakanda
he was indeed in town.

00:57:35.045 --> 00:57:37.474
But how did they find out
who made the machine?

00:57:38.137 --> 00:57:40.054
As these are extreme
confidential information.

00:57:43.463 --> 00:57:46.446
Got a new ringtone?

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:50.988
- I have to answer, boss.
- Leave the formalities now. Answer it.

00:57:51.848 --> 00:57:56.674
Hello my love.
I'm with my boss.

00:57:56.874 --> 00:57:59.439
Yes now
- Which just left.

00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:03.257
I will work from home
and then I'll take a shower.

00:58:10.459 --> 00:58:13.237
- Everett Ross?
- Queen Ramonda?

00:58:13.496 --> 00:58:15.618
What do you do with the chemical?
suri's pearl?

00:58:15.745 --> 00:58:20.443
I didn't know it was hers.
I found them at the crime scene.

00:58:20.467 --> 00:58:22.445
Do you have students at school?

00:58:22.469 --> 00:58:26.440
Suri tried to save her,
but they have both been kidnapped.

00:58:26.464 --> 00:58:31.442
Who was he kidnapped by?
SIA thinks it's you.

00:58:31.466 --> 00:58:35.457
I'm afraid they'll find out how I drove
Shuri and Okoye in the right direction.

00:58:35.481 --> 00:58:39.454
I want to help them, but
I need to know what's going on.

00:58:39.478 --> 00:58:42.449
There is a new one
global power in the game.

00:58:42.473 --> 00:58:46.635
The country we are watching or do you mean someone else?

00:58:46.855 --> 00:58:51.352
I can't say much more now.
Please let me know if the govt

00:58:51.493 --> 00:58:54.439
decide to act
based on her suspicions.

00:58:54.463 --> 00:58:55.479
Will do it.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:59:00.377
Listen, if there's anything I can do
to help, tell me.

00:59:00.471 --> 00:59:02.120
I owe Suri my life.

00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:06.451
Grio, is Suri wearing her earrings?

00:59:06.475 --> 00:59:13.458
They were lost in the North Atlantic
but her captors spoke Yucatecan.

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.693
APPLICANT'S CAPITAL
"HAITI"

00:59:22.186 --> 00:59:23.988
Welcome.

00:59:30.175 --> 00:59:31.929
Do you want to speak to the manager?

00:59:39.168 --> 00:59:40.159
There she goes.

00:59:40.183 --> 00:59:42.661
Very good...

00:59:50.173 --> 00:59:51.525
Good morning.

00:59:57.174 --> 01:00:01.039
Excuse me for a moment.

01:00:05.176 --> 01:00:07.149
Good morning.

01:00:07.173 --> 01:00:08.107
Good morning.

01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:16.147
Lady Queen Mother...

01:00:16.171 --> 01:00:18.889
Everything here is a lesson for children.

01:00:19.174 --> 01:00:24.315
They paint the walls, feed and care
the fish do whatever it takes.

01:00:24.515 --> 01:00:26.954
Some of my concepts are familiar

01:00:27.154 --> 01:00:29.493
but you use
different material now.

01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:32.891
Yes, we use what we can
to find here in Haiti.

01:00:34.182 --> 01:00:38.185
We missed you at Tsala's funeral.

01:00:49.184 --> 01:00:53.685
- Queen mother...
- It's been six years since you left.

01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:57.623
I thought you would attend
at least at the ceremony.

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:06.730
I was afraid, like the funeral
would put a definitive end to it.

01:01:06.898 --> 01:01:09.432
Nakia, daughter of Yaa.

01:01:11.093 --> 01:01:14.470
You will always be her daughter
Wakanda wherever you go.

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:19.021
You know death is not the end.

01:01:23.172 --> 01:01:24.363
Thanks

01:01:29.181 --> 01:01:31.454
How is everyone at home?

01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:35.507
- Suri was kidnapped.
- How why?

01:01:35.707 --> 01:01:39.266
You have infiltrated many countries before.

01:01:39.466 --> 01:01:41.096
It has been a long time.

01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:43.090
I was a different person then.

01:01:43.185 --> 01:01:48.824
I need someone who can find her
and save her without being seen.

01:01:49.313 --> 01:01:52.181
Who would dare
challenge Wakanda?

01:01:54.182 --> 01:01:57.148
- Oh my god.
- Breathe.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:01.255
Don't ask me to breathe.
Where the hell are we?

01:02:02.174 --> 01:02:06.162
- I am not sure.
- Oh my god, what is this?

01:02:06.186 --> 01:02:10.159
Their larvae emit light.
Just calm down.

01:02:10.183 --> 01:02:14.018
There is no new black panther
where can you call

01:02:14.085 --> 01:02:17.778
No. It doesn't work that way anymore.

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:20.164
Black Panther is in the past.

01:02:20.188 --> 01:02:24.173
Now that we've been kidnapped,
is there no black panther?

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:29.619
Princess.

01:02:30.381 --> 01:02:33.165
The members of the royal family

01:02:33.474 --> 01:02:35.765
here they wear traditional clothes.

01:02:36.171 --> 01:02:37.648
Do you understand what he says;

01:02:42.168 --> 01:02:45.582
- They made it for me.
- This is so bad.

01:02:46.274 --> 01:02:48.459
It's in every movie.
Princess Leia,

01:02:48.834 --> 01:02:53.261
Belle from "Beauty and the Beast"
the white girl from "Indiana Jones".

01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:56.182
You will be surprised to see what you need
to wear to the Warriors' Feast.

01:03:02.184 --> 01:03:04.173
Come with me.

01:03:05.768 --> 01:03:09.864
- You won't leave me here, will you?
- I'll be back.

01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:14.421
I'll be back. Calm down.

01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:22.723

YUCATAN, MEXICO

01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:41.151
- Good evening lady.
- How can I help you;

01:03:41.175 --> 01:03:44.299
My name is Maria Aldana.
I am a student of Merida.

01:03:44.399 --> 01:03:46.554
I do not care.
Go away please

01:03:46.754 --> 01:03:50.679
Yes of course. I don't want you
offend...give me a moment.

01:03:50.938 --> 01:03:53.493
My teacher mentioned a survey
to which you replied that you have met...

01:03:58.171 --> 01:04:00.189
... an inconceivable man.

01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:04.337
No one wants to talk to strangers.

01:04:05.184 --> 01:04:07.177
- I'm begging you.
- Disappear.

01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:11.022
I met him too.

01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:27.148
Sometimes I saw a winged man

01:04:27.172 --> 01:04:31.188
in the beach.
We thought it was a soul

01:04:32.183 --> 01:04:37.162
of Kukulkan, the winged one
snake god,

01:04:37.186 --> 01:04:41.152
which rules in him
the world and the under...

01:04:41.176 --> 01:04:44.188
I want to go to this beach.

01:04:45.168 --> 01:04:50.147
I warn you.
Kukulkan was there a lot

01:04:50.171 --> 01:04:52.165
before you and me

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:58.180
Others sought him and brought him
in their hearts bad faith

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.890
and they never came back.
They disappeared into the depths

01:05:02.888 --> 01:05:03.858
forever.

01:05:23.177 --> 01:05:26.170
Princess.
Welcome.

01:05:28.171 --> 01:05:30.182
Please come closer.

01:05:37.188 --> 01:05:41.930
- This is beautiful.
- It belonged to my mother.

01:05:51.186 --> 01:05:54.671
All artifacts
is from Central America,

01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:57.965
mainly of the 16th century.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.977
Have you lived since then?

01:06:02.182 --> 01:06:04.442
Your mother was human

01:06:06.168 --> 01:06:09.252
It was, but something else happened.

01:06:09.452 --> 01:06:11.753
- How?
- How?

01:06:12.529 --> 01:06:14.752
the important
it's not the how but the why.

1571
ZAMA,
YUCATAN

01:06:26.466 --> 01:06:29.299
My mother's people
were evicted from their farms

01:06:29.704 --> 01:06:32.798
because of the Spanish invaders
who brought smallpox with them.

01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:36.178
Hate for the language
and doctrine from another world.

01:06:38.124 --> 01:06:41.850
They had to face starvation,
war and disease

01:06:42.278 --> 01:06:44.182
My folks turned to Chuck...

01:06:45.177 --> 01:06:48.238
... the God of rain and wealth.

01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:52.105
Chuck showed us the way
of our spirit,

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:55.372
how he could save his people.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:03.506
Chuck gave them a plant that
grows on a blue stone

01:07:16.184 --> 01:07:19.407
My mother was pregnant
to me at the time

01:07:19.616 --> 01:07:23.864
and he did not dare to eat
from the plant so as not to lose me.

01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:25.189
No, I'm pregnant.

01:07:26.169 --> 01:07:27.746
But the spiritual was reassuring.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.640
Your child is sick.

01:07:39.019 --> 01:07:40.968
This might save him.

01:07:42.074 --> 01:07:45.091
Your child will be
the first born in our new home.

01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:47.807
Think of this gift as a promise

01:07:47.861 --> 01:07:51.372
that he will be our new king

01:07:59.186 --> 01:08:02.162
Everyone got sick.

01:08:02.186 --> 01:08:08.174
Thus their life and existence ended there.

01:08:19.184 --> 01:08:22.586
The plant took away their ability
to breathe the oxygen of the land.

01:08:22.786 --> 01:08:25.998
But he allowed them to breathe
in the sea.

01:08:29.186 --> 01:08:31.708
They settled in the ocean

01:08:32.173 --> 01:08:35.175
away from wars and diseases.

01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:39.085
Come on!

01:09:04.178 --> 01:09:06.899
That's where my mother gave birth to me...

01:09:07.099 --> 01:09:10.177
...and I became the first man
who was born in Talokan.

01:09:10.377 --> 01:09:15.162
The plant gave me winged ankles
and ears pointing to the sky.

01:09:15.186 --> 01:09:16.905
I was a mutant.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:21.187
I was flying in the sky.
But my age has slowed.

01:09:21.633 --> 01:09:24.156
And I could breathe
the air of my ancestors.

01:09:25.169 --> 01:09:26.542
My mother was getting old

01:09:28.169 --> 01:09:31.625
and mourned the life he knew

01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:35.562
and died heartbroken.

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:42.304
She made me promise her
that I would bury her in her homeland.

01:09:47.178 --> 01:09:51.188
But I wasn't ready
for what I would see there.

01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:59.189
Whose son is this?

01:10:13.184 --> 01:10:15.511
Get ready!

01:10:32.179 --> 01:10:36.570
You are the devil
Satan's seed.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:40.445
A Spanish priest cursed me
as she was dying in my arms.

01:10:40.745 --> 01:10:43.161
He called me...

01:10:43.185 --> 01:10:46.169
"The Loveless Child".

01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:49.742
"Child without love"..

01:10:50.098 --> 01:10:51.733
And from his words I got my name

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.153
"Namor".

01:10:58.177 --> 01:11:02.161
Because I had no love
for the world of earth.

01:11:02.185 --> 01:11:05.153
Why are you telling me all this?

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:10.155
To understand why you should
to kill the researcher.

01:11:10.355 --> 01:11:11.890
What if we take her to Wakanda?

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:18.549
Let us go. I give you my word
that the girl will stay in my hometown.

01:11:18.787 --> 01:11:21.601
- I can't risk it.
- Then hold me.

01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:26.153
I would like to see your nation.

01:11:26.177 --> 01:11:29.471
You can't go like that.

01:11:31.897 --> 01:11:34.615
Your body will go into immediate shock.

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:36.960
Your blood will be poisoned

01:11:37.689 --> 01:11:41.349
and the water pressure will break
every bone in your body,

01:11:44.173 --> 01:11:47.193
or you can wear a suit.
We have many options.

01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:52.187
Stay close to me.

01:12:56.168 --> 01:12:58.170

But now you see
what should i protect

01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:18.754
Your hunch was right, Nakia
I spotted Suri's earrings.

01:16:52.586 --> 01:16:55.177
The signal originates
from an underwater cave

01:16:55.527 --> 01:16:58.749
in depth approx
140 meters from the surface.

It comes from an underwater cave.

If it's down there, I'm sure
that I will meet resistance.

01:17:09.299 --> 01:17:10.676
How do you want me to act?

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:15.550
Take back the princess
by any means possible.

01:17:15.952 --> 01:17:19.416
I'll try to pull Namor out.

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:57.467
You are the first person from
surface that came to Talocan.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:00.964
Please accept this
as a token of my gratitude.

01:18:07.587 --> 01:18:10.273
It is made from the plant
who saved Talocan.

01:18:12.596 --> 01:18:14.647
You are young, Princess.

01:18:14.847 --> 01:18:16.691
If you get old like me...

01:18:17.183 --> 01:18:20.732
You understand that we all lose
everyone we love

01:18:20.932 --> 01:18:24.600
But when I lost my brother,
the feeling was different.

01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:26.718
He suffered in silence.

01:18:26.918 --> 01:18:29.742
And when he finally asked me for help,
I couldn't give it to him.

01:18:30.599 --> 01:18:33.567
How does that make sense?

01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:36.805
My ancestors gave
gifts and skills...

01:18:37.915 --> 01:18:40.228
to help save
my brother and I couldn't.

01:18:40.428 --> 01:18:42.845
Why;

01:18:44.604 --> 01:18:47.590
I don't have an answer to this question.

01:18:49.595 --> 01:18:52.054
As my ancestors used to say:

01:18:52.586 --> 01:18:55.969
"Only the most broken people
they can become great leaders"

01:18:59.597 --> 01:19:02.120
I admire what you have done here

01:19:04.794 --> 01:19:07.046
and how you protect
your people?

01:19:07.594 --> 01:19:10.571
But as the princess of Wakanda,

01:19:10.595 --> 01:19:14.575
I can't let you kill her.

01:19:14.599 --> 01:19:19.566
My nation will not rest
until I come back.

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:25.599
I'm not leaving without her.
We need to settle this peacefully.

01:19:29.593 --> 01:19:32.054
The issue is no longer about the scientist.

01:19:33.588 --> 01:19:37.551
For centuries nations have conquered
and enslave people like us

01:19:38.592 --> 01:19:40.286
only for our resources.

01:19:41.589 --> 01:19:43.428
Since the day I buried my mother,

01:19:43.628 --> 01:19:48.067
I prepare my people
for the time they will come to invade

01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:52.591
And this instrument
it's a sign that the time has come.

01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:59.274
I need to know if Wakanda
is he an ally or an enemy..

01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:01.599
There is no middle ground.

01:20:03.595 --> 01:20:07.578
So you plan to start
war all over the world...

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:12.566
and you want wakanda to help you?
This is madness.

01:20:13.258 --> 01:20:17.277
No nation would plunder
Wakanda if given the chance.

01:20:18.591 --> 01:20:23.564
If we ally, we will protect
each other from the attacks.

01:20:23.588 --> 01:20:27.605
Once they stop threatening us,
then we will eliminate them.

01:20:28.585 --> 01:20:30.971
The scientist
will return to Wakanda.

01:20:31.686 --> 01:20:34.254
And what if Wakanda refuses?

01:20:35.583 --> 01:20:37.017
The researcher will die...

01:20:38.686 --> 01:20:41.521
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

01:20:41.721 --> 01:20:44.315
- Are you going to attack my country?
- Yes.

01:20:44.602 --> 01:20:50.641
Listen to me. Wakanda will not win
never a war against the Talokan.

01:20:55.234 --> 01:20:56.780
He wants to offer you something,

01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:57.980
the Kukulkan.

01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:07.572
I heard you that night you were
with your mother near the river.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:10.588
You said you wanted to burn the world down.

01:21:16.594 --> 01:21:19.594
Let's burn him together.

LANGLEY VIRGINIA.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.277
Queen Raimonda refuses
to sell us vibranium.

01:21:30.589 --> 01:21:33.786
And now they kidnapped the young woman
who made the machine.

01:21:34.584 --> 01:21:39.354
Sincerely, Riri Williams
he is a genius with good performance.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:43.118
Wakanda recruited her.
With the program they created.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:46.156
But you sent an army at night.

01:21:46.356 --> 01:21:50.360
To arrest
the princess of a superpower.

01:21:52.595 --> 01:21:55.937
The president,
he wants to attack Wakanda.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.601
- What kind of aggressive action?
- Destabilization.

01:22:02.588 --> 01:22:06.658
Special Officer Ross
is the expert.

01:22:06.893 --> 01:22:08.363
What do you think, Ross?

01:22:08.683 --> 01:22:11.412
My sources tell me
that something else is involved.

01:22:11.727 --> 01:22:14.189
- Another nation?
- I do not know maybe.

01:22:14.389 --> 01:22:16.399
You have to give me
enough time to investigate it.

01:22:16.516 --> 01:22:19.598
Otherwise, we will meet
at war against a country,

01:22:19.728 --> 01:22:22.097
which we cannot even comprehend
military capabilities.

01:22:23.601 --> 01:22:28.124
- Ms. Director?
- He's an expert.

01:22:28.299 --> 01:22:30.793
I think the attack
in Wanda it would be wrong.

01:22:37.587 --> 01:22:39.589
- You are welcome;
- We have a problem..

KIP VERDE

01:23:00.602 --> 01:23:03.566
Is my daughter alive?

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:05.582
The princess is well and alive.

01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:11.653
He asked to be transferred to Talocan
and it will remain there for a while.
808
01:22:14,605 ​​--&gt; 01:22:18,566
What can I give you in exchange?

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:21.582
- There is nothing.
- I have a different opinion

01:23:22.843 --> 01:23:26.357
Americans think
in charge of Wakanda

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.515
for the attack on the research ship.

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:31.375
Give me back my daughter
and the researcher

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.252
otherwise I will tell them about you.

01:23:41.603 --> 01:23:44.367
If you tell the Americans about us,

01:23:45.983 --> 01:23:48.576
Or try to find us,

01:23:49.374 --> 01:23:52.704
or see even a single ship
of Wakanda in the ocean...

01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:55.156
i will kill the princess...

01:23:56.591 --> 01:24:00.817
and then I will come to Wakanda
and i will kill you

01:24:09.596 --> 01:24:11.572
So what happened?

01:24:12.977 --> 01:24:17.725
She wants to declare war on her world
surface. He asked me to help him.

01:24:21.605 --> 01:24:26.585
We have to think.
We will never leave here.

01:24:38.594 --> 01:24:41.598
- Throw your spear!
- Kill the princess!

01:24:47.592 --> 01:24:49.349
Throw away your knife.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:50.503
You

01:24:51.706 --> 01:24:52.793
I'll kill you.

01:24:52.993 --> 01:24:54.800
Let her go

01:24:55.028 --> 01:24:56.797
and I won't kill you.

01:24:59.597 --> 01:25:03.594
Suri, wave your hand.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.605
Are you ok;

01:25:11.585 --> 01:25:14.709
Give me your beads!
I can save her.

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:18.134
Suri, I don't know who she is,
but we must hear what he has to say.

01:25:18.475 --> 01:25:21.152
Look, I hit her with a sonic.
it is lethal from this distance.

01:25:21.299 --> 01:25:22.930
he will not be able to survive.

01:25:23.235 --> 01:25:25.601
You do not understand.
This will lead to war.

01:26:09.592 --> 01:26:12.597
- Have you knocked?
- No.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:14.788
Thanks.

01:26:16.047 --> 01:26:17.232
You are welcome.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:21.597
Griot, take us to Wakanda.

01:26:25.595 --> 01:26:27.592
What happened my daughter?

01:26:29.588 --> 01:26:31.552
Here come the Wakandans,

01:26:32.389 --> 01:26:34.325
and they took her.

01:26:36.594 --> 01:26:38.604
Kukulkan...

01:26:40.604 --> 01:26:44.554
... can you save me?

01:26:58.328 --> 01:26:59.385
Passed away;

01:27:01.593 --> 01:27:02.601
Yes.

01:27:11.847 --> 01:27:13.892
Rest in Peace.

01:27:16.717 --> 01:27:17.797
They came...

01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:22.342
while you were talking to the queen?

01:27:23.589 --> 01:27:27.242
She was not to be trusted.

01:27:27.587 --> 01:27:30.724
The princess saw our house.

01:27:31.024 --> 01:27:33.441
What will stop them?

01:27:33.928 --> 01:27:36.128
to attack the Taloscans?

01:27:37.604 --> 01:27:39.732
I will stop them.

01:28:14.583 --> 01:28:15.603
Rise up, Taloscans!

01:28:17.606 --> 01:28:19.986
Arm yourself, Taloscans!

01:28:25.451 --> 01:28:27.257
It blinded me...

01:28:27.557 --> 01:28:28.785
the hope...

01:28:29.315 --> 01:28:30.796
of the alliance.

01:28:32.589 --> 01:28:33.550
Me too...

01:28:34.527 --> 01:28:36.646
I put us in danger...

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.133
all of you.

01:28:40.128 --> 01:28:41.107
The Taloscan...

01:28:41.551 --> 01:28:42.906
It won't change...

01:28:43.106 --> 01:28:44.593
his place, once again.

01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:46.513
Namora.

01:28:47.785 --> 01:28:48.562
Let's go.

01:28:50.585 --> 01:28:53.603
When we're done with them...

01:28:56.781 --> 01:28:58.882
they will never think...

01:28:59.365 --> 01:29:01.029
again to approach

01:29:01.555 --> 01:29:02.570
the Taloscan.

01:29:04.601 --> 01:29:06.652
Arm yourself, Taloscans!

01:29:18.308 --> 01:29:23.733
We're glad you're back, princess.
The town has been tense since you left.

01:29:24.303 --> 01:29:28.190
Reinforce sound barriers
in all directions.

01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:31.137
- Princess?
- Neka.

01:29:33.295 --> 01:29:35.020
Thank the ancestors.

01:29:35.306 --> 01:29:38.962
I just wanted to give you these.

01:29:39.314 --> 01:29:44.310
No, keep them.
They may be needed soon.

01:29:45.292 --> 01:29:47.261
Is that where you got it from?

01:29:50.291 --> 01:29:54.282
It is true that you saw down
from the waters an empire?

01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:56.291
Yes.

01:29:57.295 --> 01:30:02.177
It's very nice,
but they are dangerous, Anika.

01:30:22.297 --> 01:30:28.093
So Miss Riri Williams?
What do you think of 'Wakanda'?

01:30:28.304 --> 01:30:32.293
The stories don't do this place justice.

01:30:33.307 --> 01:30:37.311
It's great here,
but I really want to go home.

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:41.539
- Be patient.
- Can I take my mother?

01:30:47.307 --> 01:30:51.700
The Princess was saved by Nakia.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:54.307
Glory to Hanuman.

01:30:55.311 --> 01:30:59.288
The spy saved Wakanda, again.

01:30:59.312 --> 01:31:04.312
The queen probably
he will reward her with exile.

01:31:06.302 --> 01:31:07.782
Okoye, welcome.

01:31:10.299 --> 01:31:12.293
Thank you my sister.

01:31:13.304 --> 01:31:17.281
After the attack of Thanos,
you left without saying anything

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:19.018
It hurt me.

01:31:23.294 --> 01:31:26.271
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.

01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:29.825
It wasn't easy for me.

01:31:30.294 --> 01:31:35.304
He was the King
and Black Panther, for everyone.

01:31:36.299 --> 01:31:37.695
But for me...

01:31:44.693 --> 01:31:46.533
... was everything.

01:31:47.313 --> 01:31:49.857
My T'Chala.

01:31:51.293 --> 01:31:54.402
When he was taken from me so suddenly.

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.839
I had to get away.

01:31:57.793 --> 01:31:59.698
and pick up my pieces.

01:32:02.415 --> 01:32:07.446
I couldn't go on with my life
as if nothing had happened.

01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:26.630
We are under attack.

01:32:34.293 --> 01:32:35.311
Keep it.

01:32:42.282 --> 01:32:43.192
Let's help them!

01:32:43.392 --> 01:32:44.783
Are you ok;

01:32:45.305 --> 01:32:47.470
Griot, activate defense.

01:32:48.017 --> 01:32:50.843
- Suri, where are you?
- To the lab, I'm coming.

01:32:51.002 --> 01:32:52.301
Stay where you are, it's an order!

01:32:52.458 --> 01:32:54.779
I'm with Anika, mom. We can
to provide air support.

01:32:54.846 --> 01:32:56.351
Anika, don't let her go
to leave the laboratory.

01:32:56.483 --> 01:32:59.299
Mom, I can't hear you.
You're on vacation. See you later.

01:33:01.841 --> 01:33:04.200
- Did you hang up on the Queen?
- I hung up on my mother.

01:33:04.374 --> 01:33:05.611
There is a difference.
Come on, lets go.

01:33:37.313 --> 01:33:39.313
Invaders!

01:33:45.305 --> 01:33:48.310
Mum! Mum!

01:33:51.749 --> 01:33:53.559
Turn back!

01:33:57.296 --> 01:34:00.048
Paramedics submit
in sound hypnosis.

01:34:02.305 --> 01:34:04.097
Take the child!

01:34:04.397 --> 01:34:07.293
- Close your ears, General.
- Yes, that's what I do.

01:34:53.304 --> 01:34:56.298
- Can I help;
- Come here quickly.

01:35:02.305 --> 01:35:04.292
Warrior!

01:35:06.298 --> 01:35:08.481
Cross your arms, kid.

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.311
Nakia.
We're going to find your mom, okay?

01:35:28.302 --> 01:35:29.713
The fisherman!

01:35:34.292 --> 01:35:36.940
We dropped the Palace defenses.

01:35:37.284 --> 01:35:39.238
The rest is up to you.

01:36:58.292 --> 01:36:58.808
Aid!

01:36:59.874 --> 01:37:00.530
Aid!

01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:20.562
- He is very fast.
- And faster in the water.

01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:50.300
- System Bypass.
- I'm not going to leave you.

01:38:07.292 --> 01:38:09.302
- You see him;
- Yes, there it is.

01:38:23.291 --> 01:38:24.690
Go away, my daughter.

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:28.292
- What if I leave you?
- Run!

01:38:42.309 --> 01:38:44.294
Let's go now!

01:39:45.191 --> 01:39:46.276
Help the girl.

01:39:52.508 --> 01:39:53.635
This happened because of her.

01:39:57.291 --> 01:40:01.158
I'll be back in a week
with all my army.

01:40:01.458 --> 01:40:04.630
Join us to fight.

01:40:04.757 --> 01:40:07.980
Or I'll wipe out Wakanda
from the face of the earth.

01:40:08.297 --> 01:40:09.369
Come my queen!

01:40:11.058 --> 01:40:11.580
Mother.

01:40:12.086 --> 01:40:13.016
Hold her back!

01:40:13.116 --> 01:40:13.792
Mother.

01:40:14.593 --> 01:40:16.107
Bury your dead.

01:40:17.784 --> 01:40:19.777
And mourn those you lost.

01:40:22.297 --> 01:40:24.045
You are the queen now.

01:40:29.314 --> 01:40:32.307
Let me! Mum!

01:40:40.314 --> 01:40:44.312
Mum!

01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:48.249
Wake up my queen.

01:40:49.307 --> 01:40:51.234
Let me try.

01:40:53.306 --> 01:40:56.303
Help her!
Mum.

01:40:59.299 --> 01:41:01.275
Wake up!

01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:03.311
Passed away.

01:41:46.312 --> 01:41:52.023
Condolences from the country
of Jabari for your loss.

01:41:58.307 --> 01:42:04.301
You must mourn accordingly
with ancestral rites.

01:42:07.058 --> 01:42:09.608
- Don't bother with the techniques.
- Why are you here;

01:42:11.926 --> 01:42:17.336
I promised your brother that I would
I would give you advice and protect you.

01:42:19.308 --> 01:42:22.303
But now I need it
your advice today.

01:42:25.309 --> 01:42:29.676
The elders of your tribe
they came to me with a proposal.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:35.538
They want to evacuate the city
and set up camp at Jabari.

01:42:35.738 --> 01:42:39.055
And now you want him to listen
the opinion of a little girl.

01:42:39.255 --> 01:42:41.772
To mock tradition?

01:42:45.305 --> 01:42:47.301
The world...

01:42:48.303 --> 01:42:54.938
The world has deprived you of much.
You can no longer be considered a little girl.

01:42:58.769 --> 01:43:03.086
It is in the interest of my people
to know which option you prefer.

01:43:04.306 --> 01:43:07.290
The elders are desperate.

01:43:07.314 --> 01:43:10.303
The city is vulnerable.

01:43:12.293 --> 01:43:17.304
If you help them,
they will owe you a lot.

01:43:19.308 --> 01:43:22.298
And what does your heart say?

01:43:24.314 --> 01:43:27.306
Where does it close?

01:43:28.311 --> 01:43:32.058
I just buried the last one
person who knew me well.

01:43:35.298 --> 01:43:37.310
My heart is buried with her.

01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:18.318
The oil is about to spoil.

01:44:18.447 --> 01:44:21.370
- What are you doing here;
- I am hungry. And...

01:44:21.570 --> 01:44:25.278
A tragedy struck the international community.
Sources can confirm,

01:44:25.302 --> 01:44:28.849
the death of Queen Raimonda,
Lumumba's daughter.

01:44:29.293 --> 01:44:31.125
The Western Allies blame...

01:44:31.297 --> 01:44:33.431
civil strife...
as a possible cause of death...

01:44:35.298 --> 01:44:38.174
So, do you have any comments?

01:44:40.627 --> 01:44:43.562
I wonder what else
your friends are hiding from you.

01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:45.556
What are you talking about;

01:44:45.917 --> 01:44:49.434
I don't have any unauthorized ones
contact with the kingdom of Wakanda'

01:44:52.084 --> 01:44:53.434
What about beads?

01:44:54.305 --> 01:44:57.201
- Here you go;
- The beads?

01:44:57.674 --> 01:45:00.271
There is an interception
before you deny anything.

01:45:00.295 --> 01:45:03.794
I am aware of every conversation...

01:45:04.061 --> 01:45:07.339
that you had between and the call,
that you committed treason with the queen.

01:45:07.888 --> 01:45:08.781
May he rest in peace.

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:11.445
But that's good, good for us.

01:45:11.691 --> 01:45:16.103
The Wakandans saved my life.
They are good people.

01:45:16.613 --> 01:45:20.134
Have you thought about what they could do?

01:45:20.764 --> 01:45:22.224
Have you thought about what we do?

01:45:22.376 --> 01:45:25.422
If the United States were alone
country in the world with vibranium?

01:45:26.445 --> 01:45:29.912
I have actually dreamed of this.

01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:36.335
- Put, please...
- Director de Fontaine.

01:45:39.557 --> 01:45:42.499
Your mother protected me
as if I were her child.

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.227
It's the least I can do
to try to return the favor.

01:45:47.599 --> 01:45:51.643
- We need to weaken him.
- Even if it weakens...

01:45:51.724 --> 01:45:52.901
the problem remains.

01:45:53.201 --> 01:45:56.657
Black Panther ever
he didn't let Wakanda down.

01:45:56.957 --> 01:45:58.603
Didn't you say Black Panther left?

01:46:08.591 --> 01:46:10.501
My brother is dead.

01:46:12.338 --> 01:46:14.588
But that doesn't mean
that the Black Panther is gone.

01:46:32.584 --> 01:46:37.090
Griot, start benchmarking.

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:40.491
to make an artificial parasite

01:46:42.597 --> 01:46:45.570
to put it in the fibers of the bracelet.

01:46:45.594 --> 01:46:47.032
Yes, Princess.

01:46:49.606 --> 01:46:53.242
Since these were cultivated
in vibranium-rich soil.

01:46:53.606 --> 01:46:57.898
There may be similarities between
that we can take advantage of.

01:46:58.098 --> 01:46:59.598
As you wish Princess.

01:47:04.146 --> 01:47:07.758
- Upload my brother's DNA too.
- Uploading it now.

01:47:39.269 --> 01:47:40.361
Why don't they look alike?

01:47:40.583 --> 01:47:42.734
The physiology is completely different.

01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:45.775
None of them fly either
she has pointy ears like him.

01:47:45.981 --> 01:47:49.349
The women who guarded us
they put water in their mouths and throats.

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:51.280
That's what they did.

01:47:51.558 --> 01:47:53.932
There are many organizations
which do not need gills

01:47:54.078 --> 01:47:56.728
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:02.240
For example the jellyfish.
Absorbs oxygen through the skin.

01:48:04.036 --> 01:48:05.605
This process is called diffusion.

01:48:30.685 --> 01:48:34.806
Every day that goes by without us choosing
some area is a wasted day.

01:48:35.045 --> 01:48:38.349
We have to deal with Namor
before bringing his warriors here.

01:48:38.613 --> 01:48:41.232
How do you treat a person?
who has so much power?

01:48:42.625 --> 01:48:45.040
In the attack before the plane was shot down,
went back into the water.

01:48:45.574 --> 01:48:47.180
Maybe he can draw power from her?

01:48:47.406 --> 01:48:50.684
It breathes air and absorbs
oxygen from water.

01:48:51.317 --> 01:48:53.940
If we find a way to keep him
dry will not be strong.

01:48:54.349 --> 01:48:55.719
This is.

01:48:55.919 --> 01:49:00.545
Grio, we have to move
the battle in a steam room.

01:49:00.745 --> 01:49:03.571
- This happens;
- Yes, it is possible.

01:49:03.771 --> 01:49:06.576
You will help us trap him.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.382
Please show the missus
Williams her workplace.

01:49:09.939 --> 01:49:10.766
Please come from here.

01:49:14.583 --> 01:49:17.237
How old were you when you did?
your first machine?

01:49:17.437 --> 01:49:18.528
Three years old.

01:49:18.781 --> 01:49:22.369
My stepfather was a car mechanic
and he wanted to build airplanes.

01:49:22.618 --> 01:49:25.317
He gave me tools
and let me work.

01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:32.751
- Who taught you?
- My big brother.

01:49:35.585 --> 01:49:39.105
I was the tip of the spear
of the Wakanda military.

01:49:39.435 --> 01:49:41.788
This doesn't suit me at all.

01:49:41.988 --> 01:49:46.805
Besides, I'm a citizen now.
I surrendered my gun.

01:49:47.303 --> 01:49:49.429
I also made you a new spear.

01:49:50.597 --> 01:49:53.301
- New;
- Yes.

01:49:53.603 --> 01:49:58.331
- And what did you call this thing?
- The Midnight Angel.

01:49:58.928 --> 01:50:02.435
- The Midnight Angel?
- Listen to me, Okoya.

01:50:02.635 --> 01:50:07.987
It has potential. Sister,
You must be ready when I call you.

01:50:09.822 --> 01:50:10.606
I am begging you.

01:50:14.603 --> 01:50:17.964
- Suri.
- Yes?

01:50:19.595 --> 01:50:21.600
How many of these did you make?

01:50:23.585 --> 01:50:25.581
I was looking for you in Jabari barracks.

01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:30.285
- I won't leave my house.
- You have a revolutionary spirit.

01:50:30.485 --> 01:50:33.592
- Why did you join the warriors?
- Why are you interested;

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.678
I still have the desire to fight.

01:50:43.878 --> 01:50:50.445
Tell me, Anika, daughter of Kiana,
do you still have the will to fight?

01:50:50.745 --> 01:50:52.596
What do you have in mind;

01:51:16.605 --> 01:51:21.884
Grio, what's the success rate?

01:51:22.482 --> 01:51:24.621
98.7%, Princess.

01:51:25.228 --> 01:51:27.887
Would you like me to print?
the heart shaped herb?

01:51:30.605 --> 01:51:33.594
Hello, Suri.

01:51:34.907 --> 01:51:37.224
I thought you were going back to Haiti.

01:51:37.597 --> 01:51:39.956
I'm still Wakandan.

01:51:43.972 --> 01:51:48.879
So that's what you're working on.

01:51:49.588 --> 01:51:50.573
Yes.

01:51:50.597 --> 01:51:52.968
What do you have here now?

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.579
It's an opportunity for Wakanda to have
back her patron.

01:51:59.587 --> 01:52:03.780
This will be the greatest gift

01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:07.601
and from the discovery of Basinga.

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:14.560
We'll find out soon enough.
Come.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.831
- Gray?
- Yes, Princess.

01:52:19.031 --> 01:52:20.031
Print it out.

01:52:23.595 --> 01:52:27.587
- How will we know if it worked or not?
- It will shine!

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:37.949
You did it!

01:52:42.592 --> 01:52:45.550
Let's not light incense
about the ancestors?

01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:49.387
Only the Goddess Bast knows how they got there
the ancestors in this workshop.

01:52:58.604 --> 01:53:02.200
- Surely I won't bury you?
- Yes.

01:53:02.946 --> 01:53:07.049
I want you to be able to reach
in my chest if I have a seizure.

01:53:07.377 --> 01:53:09.206
Failure;

01:53:09.605 --> 01:53:12.868
He's kidding, right?

01:53:14.601 --> 01:53:16.113
So;

01:53:21.994 --> 01:53:25.250
Allow me to leave this
the heart-shaped herb

01:53:25.450 --> 01:53:28.692
to give you
the power of the Black Panther

01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:31.774
and take you to the Realm of the Ancestors.

01:53:34.138 --> 01:53:35.177
Raimonda

01:53:35.724 --> 01:53:40.591
please come to your daughter.

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:51.597
Mother;

01:55:04.591 --> 01:55:08.019
- Ticks?
- Cousin;

01:55:08.676 --> 01:55:09.284
How;

01:55:09.484 --> 01:55:12.439
The important thing is not
the how but the why, right?

01:55:13.594 --> 01:55:16.620
- You chose me.
- No, I didn't.

01:55:17.332 --> 01:55:18.686
I would never choose you.

01:55:18.886 --> 01:55:22.318
- Why did you take the herb?
- To see my family.

01:55:22.576 --> 01:55:23.431
No, that's nonsense.

01:55:23.631 --> 01:55:26.999
You didn't think that the Ancestral Kingdom
it would be real, right?

01:55:30.267 --> 01:55:33.378
- No.
- Then why did you take it?

01:55:35.419 --> 01:55:36.607
You don't have to lie to me.

01:55:36.807 --> 01:55:40.628
- To become strong.
- Get stronger why?

01:55:42.601 --> 01:55:47.592
You see; We look alike
more than you think.

01:55:49.926 --> 01:55:51.943
You took it to get revenge
the ancestors.

01:55:52.134 --> 01:55:53.329
I'm not like you.

01:55:53.605 --> 01:55:55.911
You got it for yourself.
You consume the potion and burn the rest.

01:55:56.566 --> 01:55:58.006
Then you destroyed what was left.

01:55:58.604 --> 01:56:03.365
An unworthy king
who is afraid of being replaced.

01:56:04.402 --> 01:56:05.423
A coward.

01:56:05.623 --> 01:56:09.352
I had the courage to do what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

01:56:10.811 --> 01:56:14.403
How many people have I protected from you?
in Wakanda before I ascended the throne.

01:56:15.587 --> 01:56:21.299
Panthers were cowards before me
and before T'Challa.

01:56:21.467 --> 01:56:24.567
Don't mention my brother.
He's dead because of you.

01:56:24.591 --> 01:56:28.563
Burn the herb,
leaving us vulnerable.

01:56:28.587 --> 01:56:33.573
Namor came and killed my mother.
You are responsible for her death.

01:56:33.597 --> 01:56:39.563
Do not blame me.
And don't underestimate your mother.

01:56:39.587 --> 01:56:43.605
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young woman from the lost tribe.

01:56:44.585 --> 01:56:48.564
Your father was a hypocrite.

01:56:48.588 --> 01:56:53.603
He would have killed the girl.
He killed his own brother.

01:56:54.583 --> 01:56:57.552
T'Challa was noble.

01:56:59.583 --> 01:57:03.569
You let his killer live.

01:57:03.593 --> 01:57:06.592
And you are here standing.

01:57:10.598 --> 01:57:13.287
Will you be as noble as your brother?

01:57:13.487 --> 01:57:15.368
Or you will do the right thing...

01:57:16.733 --> 01:57:17.564
...like me;

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:21.603
Are you ok;
1123
01:56:22,603 ​​--&gt; 01:56:24,389
Are you ok;

01:57:26.596 --> 01:57:29.584
Who did you see?

01:57:33.586 --> 01:57:34.602
Nobody.

01:57:37.593 --> 01:57:42.205
- What happens;
- I failed. Did not work.

01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:43.688
Shuri...

01:57:45.603 --> 01:57:49.094
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

01:57:49.276 --> 01:57:51.615
I did everything I had to do.
I remade the herb.

01:57:51.984 --> 01:57:53.904
- Okay.
- I just did the stupid ritual

01:57:54.041 --> 01:57:54.863
and what did i get?

01:57:55.063 --> 01:57:57.779
- Why didn't they come?
- Just calm down.

01:58:03.604 --> 01:58:05.598
Damn it...

01:58:09.586 --> 01:58:11.586
Can I have it too?

01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:20.579
I think so...

01:58:20.603 --> 01:58:23.599
...that you will need a uniform.

01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:58.599
- Many people come from the city.
- We need more space.

01:58:59.598 --> 01:59:06.023
You are visitors. It is incredible
what you can achieve with anything.

01:59:31.583 --> 01:59:32.597
The princess!

02:00:05.606 --> 02:00:08.564
It succeeded!

02:00:08.588 --> 02:00:11.586
Long live the Black Panther!

02:00:28.604 --> 02:00:32.599
Namor believes
that Wakanda is weak.

02:00:33.604 --> 02:00:36.589
He murdered our Queen...

02:00:37.603 --> 02:00:40.603
...And destroyed the capital.

02:00:41.583 --> 02:00:44.580
He thinks we are vulnerable.

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:49.577
...but now it is
time to attack

02:00:49.601 --> 02:00:53.604
How; We don't even know
how to find him?

02:00:54.584 --> 02:00:57.583
- We will bring Namor to us.
- Here again?

02:00:57.621 --> 02:01:00.618
No, in a remote location.

02:01:00.818 --> 02:01:03.784
Well.
Let's say it succeeds.

02:01:06.284 --> 02:01:10.919
Who can fly and can
to be as strong as the Hulk.

02:01:13.584 --> 02:01:16.104
...the right thing is to kill him?

02:01:16.304 --> 02:01:20.572
We call for his death, when
his only crime was bullying.

02:01:20.596 --> 02:01:22.569
What has changed, Lord Embaco?

02:01:22.593 --> 02:01:26.401
His soldiers
they didn't call him General or King,

02:01:26.562 --> 02:01:28.632
he was called Ku-kul-kan.

02:01:28.832 --> 02:01:31.605
- What it means;
- "Winged Serpent Deity".

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:37.578
He believes that because we live in the mountains,
can't we read, books?

02:01:37.602 --> 02:01:41.569
Elders, with your permission.

02:01:41.593 --> 02:01:45.887
Would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku in private.

02:01:47.203 --> 02:01:47.783
Okay.

02:01:48.277 --> 02:01:48.855
Okay.

02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:57.469
Namor isn't done yet.

02:01:59.012 --> 02:02:01.845
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:04.366
Now is our chance
to defeat him.

02:02:04.525 --> 02:02:06.394
- What are you afraid of;
- The war.

02:02:06.594 --> 02:02:09.579
If they see Namor
truly as God...

02:02:09.603 --> 02:02:13.242
if we kill him,
we are in danger of perpetual war.

02:02:13.442 --> 02:02:16.581
So what; Life wasn't worth living
my mother's perpetual war?

02:02:16.605 --> 02:02:23.590
It's definitely worth it.

02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:29.138
But that's not it
that he would like for you.

02:02:33.606 --> 02:02:37.585
And that's not what I want...

02:02:38.590 --> 02:02:40.598
...for my people.

02:02:50.588 --> 02:02:53.585
You're talking about my mother
as if he is still with us.

02:02:54.594 --> 02:03:00.592
You talk about what she would want for me.
For hopes and dreams...

02:03:02.604 --> 02:03:06.604
but she is dead.
Passed away!

02:03:08.586 --> 02:03:11.605
Namor choked her in front of me.

02:03:13.593 --> 02:03:18.602
So her dreams, her goals,
and her hopes...

02:03:21.590 --> 02:03:23.602
...they don't exist.

02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:27.601
It doesn't matter anymore.

02:03:28.603 --> 02:03:32.421
What matters is what I want,

02:03:32.621 --> 02:03:35.588
and what I want is Namor dead.

02:03:38.598 --> 02:03:41.587
And you will help me defeat him.

02:03:47.601 --> 02:03:49.585
Understood?

02:03:56.596 --> 02:03:59.584
We are leaving tomorrow morning.

02:04:24.379 --> 02:04:26.393
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:04:28.392 --> 02:04:30.882
If we survive this,

02:04:31.391 --> 02:04:35.114
Know you have one
home with me in Haiti.

02:04:37.396 --> 02:04:40.394
hold my hand

02:04:43.387 --> 02:04:45.391
Breathe.

02:04:48.396 --> 02:04:54.387
Suri, be honest with me.
Who did you see when you took the herb?

02:04:59.393 --> 02:05:04.710
If you go to war for revenge, you won't
fill the void you feel from the loss.

02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:08.376
It will only grow
and it will consume you.

02:05:10.384 --> 02:05:12.380
He already has.

02:05:17.973 --> 02:05:24.947
Ku-kul-kan, a new machine
detects for vibranium in the ocean.

02:05:25.105 --> 02:05:26.079
Where;

02:05:27.387 --> 02:05:31.008 line:50%
ATLANTIC OCEAN

02:05:55.377 --> 02:05:56.393
Get out of the water!

02:06:40.395 --> 02:06:42.381
For the Queen.

02:07:56.383 --> 02:07:58.366
riri how are you

02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:03.385
- Griot, can you send help?
- You finally asked me.

02:08:14.396 --> 02:08:18.396
Come on, he's fast.
But I'm faster.

02:08:37.397 --> 02:08:39.397
I got you.

02:08:45.383 --> 02:08:47.259
It's up to you, Suri!

02:08:56.181 --> 02:08:57.780
- Princess.
- No.

02:08:58.367 --> 02:09:01.716
I am the Black Panther
and I came to take revenge.

02:09:01.916 --> 02:09:05.381
The cells were activated.

02:09:14.379 --> 02:09:17.381
What happened to you;
Would you like a glass of water?

02:09:21.383 --> 02:09:24.880
- We have it!
- Namor has been arrested.

02:09:25.347 --> 02:09:26.110
We're coming back.

02:09:30.388 --> 02:09:33.386
Back to Wakanda!

02:09:37.385 --> 02:09:38.391
We're leaving!

02:10:03.389 --> 02:10:08.183
- What happens;
- They destroyed the sonic cannon..

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:31.382
This is not a good sign.

02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:08.223
The ship lost its energy
and we have significant losses.

02:11:08.423 --> 02:11:11.392
- Okay!
- Panther.

02:11:12.396 --> 02:11:17.388
The virus!
The time has come.

02:11:28.387 --> 02:11:31.384
For Wakanda!

02:11:39.392 --> 02:11:42.364
- Griot, damage report.
- Destructive.

02:11:42.570 --> 02:11:44.523
His spear is crafted
from crude vibranium.

02:11:44.723 --> 02:11:46.843
- The ship will explode.
- Take us to the desert.

02:12:05.381 --> 02:12:06.386
No!

02:12:34.395 --> 02:12:36.382
Sink the ship!

02:13:03.393 --> 02:13:06.387
I'm holding you, sister.

02:14:10.383 --> 02:14:12.110
Warrior!

02:14:15.378 --> 02:14:17.782
You speak the mother tongue.

02:14:17.982 --> 02:14:20.791
You can use it
to greet your ancestors.

02:14:50.379 --> 02:14:51.586
Get off me!

02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:04.390
Well, come here.

02:15:08.408 --> 02:15:11.585
You will pay tribute
to your ancestors.

02:15:35.375 --> 02:15:38.370
Our ancestors will save us
if the princess doesn't hurry.

02:15:38.394 --> 02:15:41.134
We might go find them.

02:15:42.049 --> 02:15:44.394
Then let us take with us as many as we can.

02:16:14.398 --> 02:16:17.395
It could have been different.

02:16:20.398 --> 02:16:22.826
I need water.

02:16:39.377 --> 02:16:43.398
Will you be noble like your brother?
Or will you do what needs to be done...

02:16:43.646 --> 02:16:44.598
...like me;

02:16:44.798 --> 02:16:46.210
I'm not like my brother

02:16:47.379 --> 02:16:49.234
Namor will beg for mercy...

02:16:50.393 --> 02:16:52.554
while I will be by his side
and I will watch him die.

02:17:31.385 --> 02:17:34.401
King of the Empire

02:17:36.624 --> 02:17:37.673
Wakanda Forever!

02:19:26.376 --> 02:19:28.310
Suri.

02:19:29.377 --> 02:19:30.559
Mother...

02:19:32.392 --> 02:19:36.309
Show him who you are.

02:19:43.377 --> 02:19:45.358
Surrender,

02:19:45.382 --> 02:19:50.044
and Wakanda will protect
your seas and your secret.

02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:52.362
Surrender,

02:19:52.386 --> 02:19:54.336
and your people will live.

02:19:58.381 --> 02:20:03.691
We were thirsty for revenge.
We will not allow it to be conquered.

02:20:12.386 --> 02:20:14.378
Ι surrender.

02:20:39.379 --> 02:20:41.893
Tulscans!

02:20:43.379 --> 02:20:45.228
Let's go home.

02:20:45.428 --> 02:20:46.807
Our battle is over here.

02:20:59.390 --> 02:21:01.395
Wakanda Forever!

02:21:02.375 --> 02:21:04.379
Wakanda Forever!

02:21:47.965 --> 02:21:49.970
Thank you my love.

02:22:18.964 --> 02:22:22.943
- Ready to go home?
- Only the police are waiting for me.

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:27.951
Do not worry.
But I won't help you with your lessons.

02:22:27.975 --> 02:22:30.619
If you get caught, I can't help you.

02:22:31.968 --> 02:22:34.952
- Did they say you wanted to talk to me?
- Yes.

02:22:34.976 --> 02:22:40.882
Your outfit. It has a nice design, though
I can't let you take her.

02:22:41.086 --> 02:22:45.946
Correctly. I think it is the least
that I could do.

02:22:45.970 --> 02:22:48.966
I want to show you one last thing.

02:22:52.968 --> 02:22:57.438
It took me a while to find
all the pieces in the river but it was worth it.

02:22:57.975 --> 02:22:59.943
How...;

02:22:59.967 --> 02:23:05.967
It's my father's car.
We were working on it before he died.

02:23:10.970 --> 02:23:14.900
- Are you sure;
- Yes, I will send you to Boston.

02:23:15.297 --> 02:23:16.467
and it will be there before you arrive.

02:23:21.959 --> 02:23:23.544
Come here.

02:23:25.972 --> 02:23:29.957
Panther, the transporter
for Miss Williams, arrived.

02:23:29.981 --> 02:23:32.610
Take care of yourself.

02:23:32.961 --> 02:23:37.498
Are you sure you won't come?
to see the Bulls in Chicago?

02:23:38.553 --> 02:23:41.974
Sounds nice, but
I have something to take care of.

02:24:06.969 --> 02:24:11.422
Now I present to you
Princess Suri.

02:24:11.622 --> 02:24:12.738
The Black Panther!

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:33.683
Black Panther sends greetings...

02:24:35.229 --> 02:24:36.878
But he won't be with us today...

02:24:37.078 --> 02:24:38.979
I Em' Baku,

02:24:39.959 --> 02:24:44.951
Chieftain of the Jabari clan
and son of Wakanda...

02:24:44.975 --> 02:24:48.978
I would like to participate
in the challenge for the throne...

02:24:54.967 --> 02:24:56.915
What's going on, son?

02:24:58.933 --> 02:25:01.957
All my life I wanted

02:25:01.981 --> 02:25:05.870
to fight with you

02:25:06.963 --> 02:25:11.948
but I think you have submitted
to the Wakandans.

02:25:12.248 --> 02:25:17.191
Black Panther had a lot
good reason to kill me...

02:25:17.663 --> 02:25:20.857
Why do you think he didn't?

02:25:23.159 --> 02:25:27.216
The Black Panther
he is the strongest man

02:25:27.616 --> 02:25:33.399
to the most powerful nation on the surface

02:25:33.699 --> 02:25:36.678
But he has no allies.

02:25:36.978 --> 02:25:41.962
And now he has the sympathy
from the people of Talocan.

02:25:42.972 --> 02:25:45.583
With this alliance...

02:25:46.681 --> 02:25:53.446
The Talokan will be stronger than ever.

02:25:53.958 --> 02:25:57.953
the surface world
will attack Wakanda

02:25:58.549 --> 02:26:01.559
and Wakanda
will ask for our help.

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:04.322
Trust me!

02:26:20.968 --> 02:26:23.962
- What the hell is this;
- Can't we go back?

02:26:24.974 --> 02:26:30.098
- I do not know man. We'll lose an hour.
- Go see.

02:26:33.973 --> 02:26:35.552
I will save us.

02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:39.965
A tree blocks the road.
What do you want me to do;

02:26:52.976 --> 02:26:55.743
I like you in chains.

02:26:56.859 --> 02:26:58.657
When have I never seen you like this?

02:26:58.958 --> 02:27:00.974
- Very funny.
- Get out!

02:27:24.804 --> 02:27:25.447
Thanks.

02:27:28.827 --> 02:27:30.336
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:36.746
- Hello.
- Good morning.

02:27:37.943 --> 02:27:39.432
Welcome!

02:27:41.559 --> 02:27:42.664
I am glad to see you.

02:27:43.731 --> 02:27:46.065
Everything is ready.
Just give me a moment.

02:27:46.265 --> 02:27:49.457
In fact, I think everything should
to do it myself

02:27:49.981 --> 02:27:51.920
Of course.

BLACK PANTHER
WAKANTA FOREVER

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:28.044
Shuri...

02:32:29.631 --> 02:32:30.864
Can we sit with you?

02:32:34.564 --> 02:32:37.066
This is my son, Toussaint.

02:32:37.974 --> 02:32:42.825
Toussaint, this is your aunt, Suri.

02:32:44.449 --> 02:32:45.443
Hello.

02:33:06.885 --> 02:33:09.180
We had said it would be better
to grow up here.

02:33:09.722 --> 02:33:12.098
Away from the pressure of the throne.

02:33:14.505 --> 02:33:19.833
Your father, he prepared us
for his death, right?

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:30.347
But he didn't want us to come to the funeral.
He felt the time was not right.

02:33:31.423 --> 02:33:33.959
So we did
our own ceremony for him.

02:33:36.221 --> 02:33:38.729
- Did my mom meet him?
- Of course he met him.

02:33:47.963 --> 02:33:50.446
- Nice to meet you.
- Also.

02:33:50.646 --> 02:33:54.728
Toussaint is a nice name.
It has a rich history.

02:33:54.963 --> 02:33:58.395
Thanks.
You are very good too. I think so;

02:34:02.236 --> 02:34:05.126
My mom said you're good
in keeping secrets. Is true;

02:34:06.364 --> 02:34:08.278
Yes, I can keep a secret.

02:34:12.225 --> 02:34:14.047
Toussaint is my name in Haitian.

02:34:16.966 --> 02:34:18.345
Who you are;

02:34:19.384 --> 02:34:23.426
I am Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.

02:34:26.835 --> 02:34:32.137
DEDICATED TO FRIEND BOBCAT
